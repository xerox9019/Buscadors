TO THE THREE VIKINGS:

_HJALMAR, ALGERNON, AND BAYARD_.


      _Three little lovely Vikings
        Came sailing over the sea,
      From a fair and distant country,
        And put into port with me._

      _The first--how well I remember--
        Sir Hjalmar was he hight.
      With a lusty Norseland war-whoop,
        He came in the dead of night._

      _He met my respectful greeting
        With a kick and a threatening frown;
      He pressed all the house in his service,
        And turned it upside-down._

      _He thrust, when I meekly objected,
        A clinched little fist in my face;
      I had no choice but surrender,
        And give him charge of the place._

      _He heeded no creature’s pleasure;
        But oft, with a conqueror’s right,
      He sang in the small hours of morning,
        And dined in the middle of night._

      _And oft, to amuse his Highness--
        For naught we feared as his frowns--
      We bleated and barked and bellowed,
        And danced like circus-clowns._

      _Then crowed with delight our despot;
        So well he liked his home,
      He summoned his brother, Algie,
        From the realm beyond the foam._

      _And he is a laughing tyrant,
        With dimples and golden curls;
      He stole a march on our heart-gates,
        And made us his subjects and churls._

      _He rules us gayly and lightly,
        With smiles and cajoling arts;
      He went into winter-quarters
        In the innermost nooks of our hearts._

      _And Bayard, the last of my Vikings,
        As chivalrous as your name!
      With your sturdy and quaint little figure,
        What havoc you wrought when you came!_

      _There’s a chieftain in you--a leader
        Of men in some glorious path--
      For dauntless you are, and imperious,
        And dignified in your wrath._

      _You vain and stubborn and tender
        Fair son of the valiant North,
      With a voice like the storm and the north-wind,
        When it sweeps from the glaciers forth._

      _With the tawny sheen in your ringlets,
        And the Norseland light in your eyes,
      Where oft, when my tale is mournful,
        The tears unbidden arise._

      _For my Vikings love song and saga,
        Like their conquering fathers of old;
      And these are some of the stories
        To the three little tyrants I told._

THARALD’S OTTER.


Tharald and his brother Anders were bathing one day in the lake.
The water was deliciously warm, and the two boys lay quietly
floating on their backs, paddling gently with their hands. All of
a sudden Tharald gave a scream. A big trout leaped into the air,
and almost in the same instant a black, shiny head rose out of the
water right between his knees. The trout, in its descent, gave him
a slap of its slimy tail across his face. The black head stared
out at him, for a moment, with an air of surprise, then dived
noiselessly into the deep.

Anders hurried to shore as rapidly as arms and legs would propel
him.

“It was the sea-serpent,” said he.

He was so frightened that he grew almost numb; his breath stuck in
his throat, and the blood throbbed in his ears.

“Oh, you sillibub!” shouted his brother after him, “it was an otter
chasing a salmon-trout. The trout will always leap, when chased.”

He had scarcely spoken when, but a few rods from Anders, appeared
the black, shiny head again, this time with the trout in its mouth.

“He has his lair somewhere around here,” said Tharald; “let us
watch him, and see where he is going.”

The otter was nearing the shore. He swam rapidly, with a slightly
undulating motion of the body, so that, at a distance, he might
well have been mistaken for a large water-snake. When he had
reached the shore, he dragged the fish up on the sand, spied
cautiously about him, to see if he was watched, and again seizing
the trout, slid into the underbrush. There was something so
delightfully wild and wary about it that the boys felt the hunter’s
passion aroused in them, and they could scarcely take the time to
fling on their clothes before starting in pursuit. Like Indians,
they crept on hands and feet over the mossy ground, bent aside the
bushes, and peered cautiously between the leaves.

“Sh--sh--sh! we are on the track,” whispered Tharald, stooping to
smell the moss. “He has been here within a minute.”

“Here is a drop of fish-blood,” answered Anders, pointing to a
twig, over which the fish had evidently been dragged.

“Serves him right, the rascal,” murmured his elder brother.

“If we haven’t got him now, my name is not Anders,” whispered the
younger.

They had advanced about fifty rods from the water, when their
attention was arrested by two faint tracks among the stones--so
faint, indeed, that no eyes but those of a hunter would have
discovered them. A strange pungent odor, as of something wild,
pervaded the air; the whirring of the crickets in the tree-tops
seemed hushed and timid, and little silent birds hopped about in
the elder-bushes as if afraid to make a noise.

The boys lay down flat on the ground, and following the two tracks,
discovered that they converged toward a frowsy-looking juniper-bush
which grew among the roots of a big old pine. Very cautiously they
bent the bush aside.

What was that? There stood the old otter, tearing away at his
trout, and three of the prettiest little black things your eyes
ever fell upon were gambolling about him, picking up bits of the
fish, and slinging them about in their efforts to swallow.

The boys gave a cry of delight. But the otter--what do you think
he did? He showed a set of very ugly teeth, and spat like an angry
cat. It was evidently not advisable to molest him with bare hands.

In hot haste Tharald and Anders by their united weight broke off
a young elder-tree and stripped off the leaves. Now they could
venture a battle. Eagerly they pulled aside the juniper. But alas,
Mr. Otter was gone, and had taken his family with him.

To track him through the tangled underbrush, where he probably knew
a hundred hiding-places, would be a hopeless task. The boys were
about to return, baffled and disappointed, to the lake, when it
occurred to Tharald to explore the den.

There was a hole under the tree-root, just big enough to put a fist
through, and, without thought of harm, the boy flung himself down
and thrust his arm in to the very elbow. He fumbled about for a
moment--ah, what was that?--something soft and hairy, that slipped
through his fingers. Tharald made a bold grab for it--then with a
yell of pain pulled out his hand. The soft thing followed, but its
teeth were not soft. As Tharald rose to his feet, there hung a tiny
otter with its teeth locked through the fleshy part of his hand, at
the base of the thumb.

“Look here, now,” cried his brother; “sit down quietly, and I will
soon rid you of the little beast.”

Tharald, clinching his teeth, sat down on a bowlder. Anders drew
his knife.

“No, I thank you,” shouted Tharald, as he saw the knife, “I can do
that myself. I don’t want you to harm him.”

“I don’t intend to harm him,” said Anders. “I only want to force
his mouth open.”

To this Tharald submitted. The knife was carefully inserted at the
corner of the little monster’s mouth, when lo! he let the hand go,
and snapped after the knife-blade. Anders quickly threw his hat
over him, and held it down with his knees, while he tore a piece
off the lining of his coat to bandage his brother’s wound. Then
they trudged home together with the otter imprisoned in the hat.

       *       *       *       *       *

You would scarcely have thought that “Mons”--for that became the
otter’s name--would have made a pleasant companion; but strange as
it may seem, he improved much, as soon as he got into civilized
society. He soon learned that it was not good-manners to snarl and
show his teeth when politely addressed, and if occasionally he
forgot himself, he got a little tap on the nose which quickened his
memory. He was scarcely six inches long when he was caught, not
reckoning the tail; and so sleek and nimble and glossy, that it
was a delight to handle him His fur was of a very dark brown, and
when it was wet looked black. It was so dense that you could not,
by pulling the hair apart, get the slightest glimpse of the skin.
But the most remarkable things about Mons were the webs he had
between his toes, and his long glossy whiskers. Of the latter he
was particularly proud; he would allow no one to touch them.

Tharald taught him a number of tricks, which Mons learned
with astonishing ease. He was so intelligent that Sultan, the
bull-terrier, grew quite jealous of him.

Inquisitiveness seemed to be the strongest trait in Mons’s
character. His curiosity amounted to an overmastering passion.
There was no crevice that he did not feel called upon to
investigate, no hole which he did not suspect of hiding some
interesting secret. Again and again he made explorations in the
flour-barrel, and came out as white as a miller. Once, for the sake
of variety, he put his nose into the inkstand, and in attempting to
withdraw it, poured the contents over his head.

In the part of Norway where Tharald’s father lived, the people
added largely to their income by salmon-fishing. Nay, those who had
no land made their living entirely by fishing and shooting. Every
spring the salmon migrated from the sea into the rivers, to deposit
their spawn; you could see their young darting in large schools
over the pebbles in the shallows of the streams, pursued by the big
fishes that preyed upon them. Then the perch and the trout grew
fat, and the pike and the pickerel made royal meals out of the
perch and trout. All along the coast lay English schooners, ready
to buy up the salmon and carry it on ice to London. Everywhere
there was life and traffic; everybody felt prosperous and in
good-humor.

It was during this season that Tharald one day walked down to
the lake to try his luck with a fly. It had been raining during
the night; and the trees along the shore shivered and shook down
showers of raindrops. The only trouble was that the water was so
clear that you could see the bottom, which sloped gently outward
for fifty or a hundred feet. Mons, who was now a year old, was
sitting in his usual place on Tharald’s shoulder, and was gazing
contentedly upon the smiling world which surrounded him. He was so
fond of his master, now, that he followed him like a dog, and could
not bear to be long away from him.

“Mons,” said Tharald, after having vainly thrown the alluring fly a
dozen times into the river, “I think this is a bad day for fishing;
or what do you think?”

At that very instant a big salmon-trout--a six-pounder at the very
least--leaped for the fly, and with a splash of its tail sent a
shower of spray shoreward. The line flew with a hum from the reel,
and Tharald braced himself to “play” the fish, until he should tire
him sufficiently to land him.

But the trout was evidently of a different mind. He sprang out of
the water, and his beautiful spotted sides gleamed in the sun.

That was a sight for Mons! Before his master could prevent him,
he plunged from his shoulder into the lake, and shot through the
clear tide like a black arrow. The trout saw him coming, and made a
desperate leap!

The line snapped; the trout was free!

Free! It was delightful to see Mons’s supple body as it glided
through the water, bending upward, downward, sideward, with amazing
swiftness and ease. His two big eyes (which were conveniently
situated so near the tip of his nose that he could see in every
direction with scarcely a turn of the head) peered watchfully
through the transparent tide, keeping ever in the wake of the
fleeing fish. If the latter had had the sense to keep straight
ahead, he might have made good his escape. But he relied upon
strategy, and in this he was no match for Mons. He leaped out
of the water, darted to the right and to the left, and made all
sorts of foolish and flurried manœuvres. But with the calmness of
a Von Moltke, Mons outgeneralled him. He headed him off whenever
he turned, and finally by a brisk turn plunged his teeth into the
trout’s neck, and brought him to land.

I need not tell you that Tharald made a hero of him. He hugged him
and patted him and called him pet names, until Mons grew quite
bashful. But this exploit of Mons’s gave Tharald an idea. He
determined to train him as a salmon-fisher.

It was in the spring of 1880, when Mons was two years old and fully
grown, that he landed his first salmon. And when he had landed the
first, it cost him little trouble to secure the second and the
third. Tharald felt like a rich man that day, as he carried home
in his basket three silvery beauties, worth, at the very least, a
dollar and a half apiece. He made haste to dispose of them to an
English yachtsman at that figure, and went home in a radiant humor,
dreaming of “gold and forests green,” as the Norwegians say.

“Now, Mons,” he said to his friend, whom he was leading after him
by a chain, “if we do as well every day as we have done to-day, we
shall soon be rich enough to go to school. What do you think of
that, Mons?”

One day a big fish-tail splashed out of an eddy, and a black furry
head and back rose for an instant and were whirled out of sight.

“Oh, dear, dear,” cried Tharald, “he will die! He will drown! How
often have I told you, Mons,” he shouted, “that you shouldn’t
attack fishes that are bigger than yourself.”

“Whom are you talking to?” asked a fisherman named John Bamle, who
had come to look after his traps.

“To Mons,” answered the boy, anxiously.

“You don’t mean to say your brother is out there in the water!”
shouted John Bamle, in amazement.

“Yes, Mons, my otter,” cried Tharald, piteously.

“Mons, your brother!” yelled the man, and seizing a boat-hook,
he ran out on the beams from which the traps were suspended. The
roar of the waters was so loud that it was next to impossible to
distinguish words, and “Mons, my otter,” and “Mons, my brother,”
sounded so much alike that it was not wonderful that John mistook
the former for the latter. For awhile he balanced himself by means
of the boat-hook on the slippery beams, peering all the while
anxiously into the rapids.

Suddenly he saw something struggling in the water; showers of spray
whirled upward. Could it be possible that a fish had attacked
the drowning child? Full of pity, he stretched himself forward,
extending the boat-hook before him, when lo! he lost his balance,
and tumbled headlong into the cataract.

Half a dozen other fishermen who were sauntering down the
hill-sides saw their comrade fall, and rushed into the water to
rescue him.

One man, bolder than the rest, sat astride a floating log and
rode out into the seething current. Now he was thrown off; now he
scrambled up again; at last, as his drowning comrade appeared for
the third time, with an arm extended out of a whirling eddy, he
caught him deftly with his boat-hook, and pulled him up toward the
log.

As John Bamle lay there, more dead than alive, upon the bank,
emitting streams of water through mouth and nostrils, the question
was asked how he came to endanger his life in such a reckless
manner. At that very instant the head of a black otter was seen
emerging from the water, dragging a huge salmon up among the stones.

“Look, the otter, the otter!” cried the men; and a shower of
stones hailed down upon the bowlder upon which Mons had sought
refuge.

“Let him alone, I tell you!” screamed Tharald; “he is mine.”

And with three leaps he was at Mons’s side, wringing wet from top
to toe, but happy to have his friend once more in safety. He seized
him in his arms, and would have borne him ashore, if the enormous
salmon had not demanded all his strength.

As they again reached the bank, the fishermen gathered about them;
but Mons slunk cautiously at his master’s heels. He understood
the growling comments, as one man after the other lifted the big
salmon and estimated its weight. John Bamle had now so far regained
consciousness that he could speak, and he stared with no friendly
eye at the boy who had come near causing his death.

“Come, now, Mons,” said Tharald, “come, and let us hurry home to
breakfast.”

“Mons!” repeated John Bamle; “is _that_ your Mons?”

“Yes, that is my Mons,” answered Tharald, innocently.

“Then you just wait till I am strong enough to stand on my legs,
and I’ll promise to give you a thrashing that you’ll remember to
your dying day,” said John, and shook his big fist.

Tharald was not anxious to wait under such circumstances, but
betook himself homeward as rapidly as his legs would carry him.

During the next week Tharald did his best to avoid the fishermen.
And yet, try as he might, he could not help meeting them on the
road, or on the river-bank, as he carried home his heavy load of
salmon.

“Hallo! How is your brother Mons?” they jeered, when they saw him.

Occasionally they stopped and glanced into his basket; and Tharald
noticed that they glowered unpleasantly at him, whenever he had
caught a fine fish. The fact was, he had had extraordinary luck
this week; for Mons was getting to be such an expert, that he
scarcely ever dived without bringing something or other ashore.

He had almost money enough now to pay for a year’s schooling, and
he could scarcely sleep for joy when he thought of the bright
future that stretched out before him. He saw himself in all manner
of delightful situations. Mons, in the meanwhile, who was not
troubled with this kind of ambition, snoozed peacefully in his
box, at the foot of his master’s bed. He did not dream what a rude
awakening was in store for him.

       *       *       *       *       *

It had been a very bad week for John Bamle and his comrades.
Morning after morning their traps were empty, or one solitary fish
lay sprawling at the bottom of the box.

“I tell you, boys,” said John, spitting into his fist, and shaking
it threateningly against the sky, “I am bewitched; that’s what I
am. And so are you, boys--every mother’s son of you. It is that
Gimlehaug boy that has bewitched us. Are you fools enough to
suppose that it is a natural beast--that black thing--that trots
at his heels, and empties the river of its fish for his benefit?
Not by a jugful, lads--not by a big jugful! The devil it is--the
black Satan himself--or my name is not John Bamle. You never saw a
beast act like that before, plunging into the yellow whirlpools,
and coming back unscathed every time, and with a fish as big as
himself dangling after him. Now, shall we stand that any longer,
boys? We have wives and babies at home, crying for food! And here
we come daily, and find empty traps. Now wake up, lads, and be men!
There has come a day of reckoning for him who has sold himself
to the devil. I, for my part, am just mad enough to venture on a
tussle with old Nick himself.”

Every word that John uttered fell like a firebrand into the men’s
hearts. They shouted wildly, shook their fists, and swung their
long boat-hooks.

“We’ll kill him, the thief,” they cried, “the scoundrel! He has
sold himself to the devil.”

Up they rushed from the river-bank, up the green hillsides, up the
rocky slope, until they reached the gate at Gimlehaug. It was but
a small turf-thatched cottage, with tiny lead-framed window-panes
and a rude stone chimney. The father was out working by the day,
and the two boys were at home alone. Tharald, who was sitting at
the window reading, felt suddenly a paw tapping him on the cheek.
It was Mons. In the same instant an angry murmur of many voices
reached his ear, and he saw a crowd of excited fishermen, with
boat-hooks in their hands, thronging through the gate. There were
twenty or thirty of them at the very least. Tharald sprang forward
and bolted the door. He knew why they had come. Then he snatched
Mons up in his arms, and hugged him tightly.

“Let them do their worst, Mons,” he said; “whatever happens, you
and I will stand by each other.”

Anders, Tharald’s brother, came rushing in by the back door. He,
too, had seen the men coming.

“Hide yourself, hide yourself, Tharald!” he cried in alarm; “it is
you they are after.”

Hide yourself! That was more easily said than done. The hut was now
surrounded, and there was no escape.

“Climb up the chimney,” begged Anders; “hurry, hurry! you have no
time to lose.”

Happily there was no fire on the hearth, and Tharald, still hugging
Mons tightly, allowed himself to be pushed by his brother up the
sooty tunnel. Scarcely was Anders again out on the floor, when
there was a tremendous thump at the door, so that the hut trembled.

“Open the door, I say!” shouted John Bamle without.

Anders, knowing how easily he could force the door, if he wished,
drew the bolt and opened.

“I want the salmon-fisher,” said John, fiercely.

“Yes, we want the salmon-fisher,” echoed the crowd, wildly.

“What salmon-fisher?” asked Anders, with feigned surprise.

“Don’t you try your tricks on me, you rascal,” yelled John,
furiously; and seizing the boy by the collar, flung him out through
the door. The crowd stormed in after him. They tore up the beds,
and scattered the straw over the floor; upset the furniture,
ransacked drawers and boxes. But no trace did they find of him whom
they sought. Then finally it occurred to someone to look up the
chimney, and a long boat-hook was thrust up to bring down whatever
there might be hidden there. Tharald felt the sharp point in his
thigh, and he knew that he was discovered. With the strength of
despair he tore himself loose, leaving part of his trousers on the
hook, and, climbing upward, sprang out upon the roof. His thigh was
bleeding, but he scarcely noticed it. His eyes and hair were full
of soot, and his face was as black as a chimney-sweep’s. The men,
when they saw him, jeered and yelled with derisive laughter.

“Hand us down your devilish beast there, and we won’t hurt you!”
cried John Bamle.

“No, I won’t,” answered Tharald.

“By the heavens, lad, if you don’t mind, it will go hard with you.”

“I am not afraid,” said Tharald.

“Then we’ll make you, you beastly brat,” yelled a furious voice in
the crowd; and instantly a stone whistled past the boy’s ear, and
fell with a thump on the turf below.

“Now, will you give up your beast?”

Tharald hesitated a moment. Should he give up Mons, who had been
his friend and playmate for two years, and see him stoned to death
by the cruel men? Mons fixed his black, liquid eyes upon him as if
he would ask him that very question. No, no, he could not forsake
Mons. A second stone, bigger than the first, flew past him, and he
had to dodge quickly behind the chimney, as the third and fourth
followed.

“Tharald, Tharald!” cried Anders, imploringly; “do let the otter
go, or they will kill both you and him.”

Before Tharald could answer, a shower of stones fell about him. One
hit him in the forehead; the sparks danced before his eyes. A warm
current rushed down his face; dizziness seized him; he fell, he
did not know where or how. John Bamle with a yell sprang forward,
climbed up the low wall to the roof, and saw the boy lying, as if
dead, behind the chimney. He turned to call for his boat-hook, when
suddenly something black shot toward him from the chimney-top,
and a set of terrible teeth buried themselves in his throat. The
mere force of the leap made him lose his balance, and he tumbled
backward into the yard.

In the same instant Mons bounded forward, lighted on somebody’s
shoulder, and made for the woods. Before anybody had time to think,
he was out of sight.

Thus ended the famous battle of Gimlehaug, of which the
salmon-fishers yet speak in the valley. Or rather, I should say, it
did not end there, for John Bamle lay ill for several weeks, and
had to have his wound sewed up by the doctor.

As for Tharald, he got well within a few days. But a strange
uneasiness came over him, and he roamed through the woods early
and late, seeking his lost friend. At the end of a week, as he was
sitting, one night, on the rocks at the river, he suddenly felt
something hairy rubbing against his nose. He looked up, and with a
scream of joy clasped Mons in his arms. Then he hurried home, and
had a long talk with his father. And the end of it was, that with
the money which Mons had earned by his salmon-fishing, tickets were
bought for New York for the entire family. About a month later they
landed at Castle Garden.

Tharald and Mons are now doing a large fish-business, without fear
of harm, in one of the great lakes of Wisconsin. Some day, he hopes
yet, it may lead to a parsonage. Since he learned that some of the
apostles were fishermen, he feels that he is on the right road to
the goal of his ambition.




BETWEEN SEA AND SKY.


I.

“Iceland is the most beautiful land the sun doth shine upon,” said
Sigurd Sigurdson to his two sons.

“How can you know that, father,” asked Thoralf, the elder of the
two boys, “when you have never been anywhere else?”

“I know it in my heart,” said Sigurd, devoutly.

“It is, after all, a matter of taste,” observed the son. “I think
if I were hard pressed, I might be induced to put up with some
other country.”

“You ought to blush with shame,” his father rejoined warmly. “You
do not deserve the name of an Icelander, when you fail to see
how you have been blessed in having been born in so beautiful a
country.”

“I wish it were less beautiful and had more things to eat in it,”
muttered Thoralf. “Salted codfish, I have no doubt, is good for the
soul, but it rests very heavily on the stomach, especially when you
eat it three times a day.”

“You ought to thank God that you have codfish, and are not a naked
savage on some South Sea isle, who feeds, like an animal, on the
herbs of the earth.”

“But I like codfish much better than smoked puffin,” remarked Jens,
the younger brother, who was carving a pipe-bowl. “Smoked puffin
always makes me sea-sick. It tastes like cod-liver oil.”

Sigurd smiled, and, patting the younger boy on the head, entered
the cottage.

“You shouldn’t talk so to father, Thoralf,” said Jens, with
superior dignity; for his father’s caress made him proud and
happy. “Father works so hard, and he does not like to see anyone
discontented.”

“That is just it,” replied the elder brother; “he works so hard,
and yet barely manages to keep the wolf from the door. That is what
makes me impatient with the country. If he worked so hard in any
other country he would live in abundance, and in America he would
become a rich man.”

This conversation took place one day, late in the autumn, outside
of a fisherman’s cottage on the north-western coast of Iceland.
The wind was blowing a gale down from the ice-engirdled pole, and
it required a very genial temper to keep one from getting blue.
The ocean, which was but a few hundred feet distant, roared like
an angry beast, and shook its white mane of spray, flinging it
up against the black clouds. With every fresh gust of wind, a
shower of salt water would fly hissing through the air and whirl
about the chimney-top, which was white on the windward side from
dried deposits of brine. On the turf-thatched roof big pieces of
drift-wood, weighted down with stones, were laid lengthwise and
crosswise, and along the walls fishing-nets hung in festoons from
wooden pegs. Even the low door was draped, as with decorative
intent, with the folds of a great drag-net, the clumsy cork-floats
of which often dashed into the faces of those who attempted to
enter. Under a driftwood shed which projected from the northern
wall was seen a pile of peat, cut into square blocks, and a
quantity of the same useful material might be observed down at the
beach, in a boat which the boys had been unloading when the storm
blew up. Trees no longer grow in the island, except the crippled
and twisted dwarf-birch, which creeps along the ground like a
snake, and, if it ever dares lift its head, rarely grows more
than four or six feet high. In the olden time, which is described
in the so-called sagas of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
Iceland had very considerable forests of birch and probably also of
pine. But they were cut down; and the climate has gradually been
growing colder, until now even the hardiest tree, if it be induced
to strike root in a sheltered place, never reaches maturity. The
Icelanders therefore burn peat, and use for building their houses
driftwood which is carried to them by the Gulf Stream from Cuba and
the other well-wooded isles along the Mexican Gulf.

“If it keeps blowing like this,” said Thoralf, fixing his weather
eye on the black horizon, “we shan’t be able to go a-fishing; and
mother says the larder is very nearly empty.”

“I wish it would blow down an Englishman or something on us,”
remarked the younger brother; “Englishmen always have such lots of
money, and they are willing to pay for everything they look at.”

“While you are a-wishing, why don’t you wish for an American?
Americans have mountains and mountains of money, and they don’t
mind a bit what they do with it. That’s the reason I should like to
be an American.”

“Yes, let us wish for an American or two to make us comfortable for
the winter. But I am afraid it is too late in the season to expect
foreigners.”

The two boys chatted together in this strain, each working at some
piece of wood-carving which he expected to sell to some foreign
traveller. Thoralf was sixteen years old, tall of growth, but
round-shouldered, from being obliged to work when he was too young.
He was rather a handsome lad, though his features were square and
weather-beaten, and he looked prematurely old. Jens, the younger
boy, was fourteen years old, and was his mother’s darling. For
even up under the North Pole mothers love their children tenderly,
and sometimes they love one a little more than another; that is,
of course, the merest wee bit of a fraction of a trifle more.
Icelandic mothers are so constituted that when one child is a
little weaker and sicklier than the rest, and thus seems to be more
in need of petting, they are apt to love their little weakling
above all their other children, and to lavish the tenderest care
upon that one. It was because little Jens had so narrow a chest,
and looked so small and slender by the side of his robust brother,
that his mother always singled him out for favors and caresses.


II.

All night long the storm danced wildly about the cottage, rattling
the windows, shaking the walls, and making fierce assaults upon
the door, as if it meant to burst in. Sometimes it bellowed
hoarsely down the chimney, and whirled the ashes on the hearth,
like a gray snowdrift, through the room. The fire had been put
out, of course; but the dancing ashes kept up a fitful patter,
like that of a pelting rainstorm, against the walls; they even
penetrated into the sleeping alcoves and powdered the heads of
their occupants. For in Iceland it is only well-to-do people who
can afford to have separate sleeping-rooms; ordinary folk sleep
in little closed alcoves, along the walls of the sitting-room;
masters and servants, parents and children, guests and wayfarers,
all retiring at night into square little holes in the walls, where
they undress behind sliding trapdoors which may be opened again,
when the lights have been put out, and the supply of air threatens
to become exhausted. It was in a little closet of this sort that
Thoralf and Jens were lying, listening to the roar of the storm.
Thoralf dozed off occasionally, and tried gently to extricate
himself from his frightened brother’s embrace; but Jens lay with
wide-open eyes, staring into the dark, and now and then sliding
the trapdoor aside and peeping out, until a blinding shower of
ashes would again compel him to slip his head under the sheepskin
coverlet. When at last he summoned courage to peep out, he could
not help shuddering. It was terribly cheerless and desolate. And
all the time his father’s words kept ringing ironically in his
ears: “Iceland is the most beautiful land the sun doth shine upon.”
For the first time in his life he began to question whether his
father might not possibly be mistaken, or, perhaps, blinded by his
love for his country. But the boy immediately repented of this
doubt, and, as if to convince himself in spite of everything, kept
repeating the patriotic motto to himself until he fell asleep.

It was yet pitch dark in the room, when he was awakened by his
father, who stood stooping over him.

“Sleep on, child,” said Sigurd; “it was your brother I wanted to
wake up, not you.”

“What is the matter, father? What has happened?” cried Jens, rising
up in bed, and rubbing the ashes from the corners of his eyes.

“We are snowed up,” said the father, quietly. “It is already nine
o’clock, I should judge, or thereabouts, but not a ray of light
comes through the windows. I want Thoralf to help me open the door.”

Thoralf was by this time awake, and finished his primitive toilet
with much despatch. The darkness, the damp cold, and the unopened
window-shutters impressed him ominously. He felt as if some
calamity had happened or were about to happen. Sigurd lighted a
piece of driftwood and stuck it into a crevice in the wall. The
storm seemed to have ceased; a strange, tomb-like silence prevailed
without and within. On the hearth lay a small snowdrift which
sparkled with a starlike glitter in the light.

“Bring the snow-shovels, Thoralf,” said Sigurd. “Be quick; lose no
time.”

“They are in the shed outside,” answered Thoralf.

“That is very unlucky,” said the father; “now we shall have to use
our fists.”

The door opened outward and it was only with the greatest
difficulty that father and son succeeded in pushing it ajar. The
storm had driven the snow with such force against it that their
efforts seemed scarcely to make any impression upon the dense white
wall which rose up before them.

“This is of no earthly use, father,” said the boy; “it is a day’s
job at the very least. Let me rather try the chimney.”

“But you might stick in the snow and perish,” objected the father,
anxiously.

“Weeds don’t perish so easily,” said Thoralf. “Stand up on the
hearth, father, and I will climb up on your shoulders.”

Sigurd half reluctantly complied with his request. Thoralf crawled
up his back, and soon planted his feet on the parental shoulders.
He pulled his knitted woollen cap over his eyes and ears so
as to protect them from the drizzling soot which descended in
intermittent showers. Then groping with his toes for a little
projection of the wall, he gained a securer foothold, and pushing
boldly on, soon thrust his sooty head through the snow-crust. A
chorus as of a thousand howling wolves burst upon his bewildered
sense; the storm raged, shrieked, roared, and nearly swept him off
his feet. Its biting breath smote his face like a sharp whip-lash.

“Give me my sheepskin coat,” he cried down into the cottage; “the
wind chills me to the bone.”

The sheepskin coat was handed to him on the end of a pole, and
seated upon the edge of the chimney, he pulled it on and buttoned
it securely. Then he rolled up the edges of his cap in front and
cautiously exposed his eyes and the tip of his nose. It was not a
pleasant experiment, but one dictated by necessity. As far as he
could see, the world was white with snow, which the storm whirled
madly around, and swept now earthward, now heavenward. Great
funnel-shaped columns of snow danced up the hillsides and vanished
against the black horizon. The prospect before the boy was by no
means inviting, but he had been accustomed to battle with dangers
since his earliest childhood, and he was not easily dismayed. With
much deliberation, he climbed over the edge of the chimney, and
rolled down the slope of the roof in the direction of the shed. He
might have rolled a great deal farther, if he had not taken the
precaution to roll against the wind. When he had made sure that
he was in the right locality, he checked himself by spreading his
legs and arms; then judging by the outline of the snow where the
door of the shed was, he crept along the edge of the roof on the
leeward side. He looked more like a small polar bear than a boy,
covered, as he was, with snow from head to foot. He was prepared
for a laborious descent, and raising himself up he jumped with all
his might, hoping that his weight would carry him a couple of feet
down. To his utmost astonishment he accomplished considerably more.
The snow yielded under his feet as if it had been eiderdown, and
he tumbled headlong into a white cave right at the entrance to the
shed. The storm, while it had packed the snow on the windward side,
had naturally scattered it very loosely on the leeward, which left
a considerable space unfilled under the projecting eaves.

Thoralf picked himself up and entered the shed without difficulty.
He made up a large bundle of peat, which he put into a basket
which could be carried, by means of straps, upon his back. With
a snow-shovel he then proceeded to dig a tunnel to the nearest
window. This was not a very hard task, as the distance was not
great. The window was opened and the basket of peat, a couple
of shovels, and two pairs of skees[1] (to be used in case of
emergency) were handed in. Thoralf himself, who was hungry as
a wolf, made haste to avail himself of the same entrance. And
it occurred to him as a happy afterthought that he might have
saved himself much trouble, if he had selected the window instead
of the chimney when he sallied forth on his expedition. He had
erroneously taken it for granted that the snow would be packed as
hard everywhere as it was at the front door. The mother, who had
been spending this exciting half-hour in keeping little Jens warm,
now lighted a fire and made coffee; and Thoralf needed no coaxing
to do justice to his breakfast, even though it had, like everything
else in Iceland, a flavor of salted fish.


III.

Five days had passed, and still the storm raged with unabated
fury. The access to the ocean was cut off, and, with that, access
to food. Already the last handful of flour had been made into
bread, and of the dried cod which hung in rows under the ceiling
only one small and skinny specimen remained. The father and the
mother sat with mournful faces at the hearth, the former reading
in his hymn-book, the latter stroking the hair of her youngest
boy. Thoralf, who was carving at his everlasting pipe-bowl (a
corpulent and short-legged Turk with an enormous mustache), looked
up suddenly from his work and glanced questioningly at his father.

“Father,” he said, abruptly, “how would you like to starve to
death?”

“God will preserve us from that, my son,” answered the father,
devoutly.

“Not unless we try to preserve ourselves,” retorted the boy,
earnestly. “We can’t tell how long this storm is going to last, and
it is better for us to start out in search of food now, while we
are yet strong, than to wait until later, when, as likely as not,
we shall be weakened by hunger.”

“But what would you have me do, Thoralf?” asked the father, sadly.
“To venture out on the ocean in this weather would be certain
death.”

“True; but we can reach the Pope’s Nose on our skees, and there we
might snare or shoot some auks and gulls. Though I am not partial
to that kind of diet myself, it is always preferable to starvation.”

“Wait, my son, wait,” said Sigurd, earnestly. “We have food enough
for to-day, and by to-morrow the storm will have ceased, and we may
go fishing without endangering our lives.”

“As you wish, father,” the son replied, a trifle hurt at his
father’s unresponsive manner; “but if you will take a look out of
the chimney, you will find that it looks black enough to storm for
another week.”

The father, instead of accepting this suggestion, went quietly to
his book-case, took out a copy of Livy, in Latin, and sat down
to read. Occasionally he looked up a word in the lexicon (which
he had borrowed from the public library at Reykjavik), but read
nevertheless with apparent fluency and pleasure. Though he was
a fisherman, he was also a scholar, and during the long winter
evenings he had taught himself Latin and even a smattering of
Greek.[2] In Iceland the people have to spend their evenings
at home; and especially since their millennial celebration in
1876, when American scholars[3] presented them with a large
library, books are their unfailing resource. In the case of Sigurd
Sigurdson, however, books had become a kind of dissipation, and he
had to be weaned gradually of his predilection for Homer and Livy.
His oldest son especially looked upon Latin and Greek as a vicious
indulgence, which no man with a family could afford to foster. Many
a day when Sigurd ought to have been out in his boat casting his
nets, he stayed at home reading. And this, in Thoralf’s opinion,
was the chief reason why they would always remain poor, and run the
risk of starvation, whenever a stretch of bad weather prevented
them from going to sea.

The next morning--the sixth since the beginning of the
storm--Thoralf climbed up to his post of observation on the chimney
top, and saw, to his dismay, that his prediction was correct. It
had ceased snowing, but the wind was blowing as fiercely as ever,
and the cold was intense.

“Will you follow me, father, or will you not?” he asked, when he
had accomplished his descent into the room. “Our last fish is now
eaten, and our last loaf of bread will soon follow suit.”

“I will go with you, my son,” answered Sigurd, putting down his
Livy reluctantly. He had just been reading for the hundredth time
about the expulsion of the Tarquins from Rome, and his blood was
aglow with sympathy and enthusiasm.

“Here is your coat, Sigurd,” said his wife, holding up the great
sheepskin garment, and assisting him in putting it on.

“And here are your skees and your mittens and your cap,” cried
Thoralf, eager to seize the moment, when his father was in the mood
for action.

Muffled up like Esquimaux to their very eyes, armed with bows and
arrows and long poles with nooses of horse-hair at the ends, they
sallied forth on their skees. The wind blew straight into their
faces, forcing their breath down their throats and compelling
them to tack in zigzag lines like ships in a gale. The promontory
called “The Pope’s Nose” was about a mile distant; but in spite of
their knowledge of the land, they went twice astray, and had to
lie down in the snow, every now and then, so as to draw breath and
warm the exposed portions of their faces. At the end of nearly two
hours they found themselves at their destination, but, to their
unutterable astonishment, the ocean seemed to have vanished, and as
far as their eyes could reach, a vast field of packed ice loomed
up against the sky in fantastic bastions, turrets, and spires. The
storm had driven down this enormous arctic wilderness from the
frozen precincts of the pole; and now they were blockaded on all
sides, and cut off from all intercourse with humanity.

“We are lost, Thoralf,” muttered his father, after having gazed for
some time in speechless despair at the towering icebergs; “we might
just as well have remained at home.”

“The wind, which has blown the ice down upon us can blow it away
again, too,” replied the son, with forced cheerfulness.

“I see no living thing here,” said Sigurd, spying anxiously seaward.

“Nor do I,” rejoined Thoralf; “but if we hunt, we shall. I have
brought a rope, and I am going to pay a little visit to those auks
and gulls that must be hiding in the sheltered nooks of the rocks.”

“Are you mad, boy?” cried the father in alarm. “I will never permit
it!”

“There is no help for it, father,” said the boy resolutely. “Here,
you take hold of one end of the rope; the other I will secure about
my waist. Now, get a good strong hold, and brace your feet against
the rock there.”

Sigurd, after some remonstrance, yielded, as was his wont, to his
son’s resolution and courage. Stepping off his skees, which he
stuck endwise into the snow, and burrowing his feet down until
they reached the solid rock, he tied the rope around his waist and
twisted it about his hands, and at last, with quaking heart, gave
the signal for the perilous enterprise. The promontory, which rose
abruptly to a height of two or three hundred feet from the sea,
presented a jagged wall full of nooks and crevices glazed with
frozen snow on the windward side, but black and partly bare to
leeward.

“Now let go!” shouted Thoralf; “and stop when I give a slight pull
at the rope.”

“All right,” replied his father.

And slowly, slowly, hovering in mid-air, now yielding to an
irresistible impulse of dread, now brave, cautious, and confident,
Thoralf descended the cliff, which no human foot had ever trod
before. He held in his hand the pole with the horse-hair noose,
and over his shoulder hung a foxskin hunting-bag. With alert,
wide-open eyes he spied about him, exploring every cranny of the
rock, and thrusting his pole into the holes where he suspected
the birds might have taken refuge. Sometimes a gust of wind would
have flung him violently against the jagged wall if he had not,
by means of his pole, warded off the collision. At last he caught
sight of a bare ledge, where he might gain a secure foothold; for
the rope cut him terribly about the waist, and made him anxious
to relieve the strain, if only for a moment. He gave the signal
to his father, and by the aid of the pole swung himself over to
the projecting ledge. It was uncomfortably narrow, and, what was
worse, the remnants of a dozen auks’ nests had made the place
extremely slippery. Nevertheless, he seated himself, allowing his
feet to dangle, and gazed out upon the vast ocean, which looked
in its icy grandeur like a forest of shining towers and minarets.
It struck him for the first time in his life that perhaps his
father was right in his belief that Iceland was the fairest land
the sun doth shine upon; but he could not help reflecting that it
was a very unprofitable kind of beauty. The storm whistled and
howled overhead, but under the lee of the sheltering rock it blew
only in fitful gusts with intermissions of comparative calm. He
knew that in fair weather this was the haunt of innumerable sea
birds, and he concluded that even now they could not be far away.
He pulled up his legs, and crept carefully on hands and feet
along the slippery ledge, peering intently into every nook and
crevice. His eyes, which had been half-blinded by the glare of the
snow, gradually recovered their power of vision. There! What was
that? Something seemed to move on the ledge below. Yes, there sat
a long row of auks, some erect as soldiers, as if determined to
face it out; others huddled together in clusters, and comically
woe-begone. Quite a number lay dead at the base of the rock,
whether from starvation or as the victims of fierce fights for the
possession of the sheltered ledges could scarcely be determined.
Thoralf, delighted at the sight of anything eatable (even though
it was poor eating), gently lowered the end of his pole, slipped
the noose about the neck of a large, military-looking fellow, and,
with a quick pull, swung him out over the ice-field. The auk gave
a few ineffectual flaps with his useless wings,[4] and expired.
His picking off apparently occasioned no comment whatever in his
family, for his comrades never uttered a sound nor stirred an inch,
except to take possession of the place he had vacated. Number two
met his fate with the same listless resignation; and numbers three,
four, and five were likewise removed in the same noiseless manner,
without impressing their neighbors with the fact that their turn
might come next. The birds were half-benumbed with hunger, and
their usually alert senses were drowsy and stupefied. Nevertheless,
number six, when it felt the noose about its neck, raised a hubbub
that suddenly aroused the whole colony, and, with a chorus of wild
screams, the birds flung themselves down the cliffs or, in their
bewilderment, dashed headlong down upon the ice, where they lay
half stunned or helplessly sprawling. So, through all the caves
and hiding-places of the promontory the commotion spread, and
the noise of screams and confused chatter mingled with the storm
and filled the vault of the sky. In an instant a great flock of
gulls was on the wing, and circled with resentful shrieks about
the head of the daring intruder who had disturbed their wintry
peace. The wind whirled them about, but they still held their own,
and almost brushed with their wings against his face, while he
struck out at them with his pole. He had no intention of catching
them; but, by chance, a huge burgomaster gull[5] got its foot into
the noose. It made an ineffectual attempt to disentangle itself,
then, with piercing screams, flapped its great wings, beating
the air desperately. Thoralf, having packed three birds into his
hunting-bag, tied the three others together by the legs, and flung
them across his shoulders. Then, gradually trusting his weight to
the rope, he slid off the rock, and was about to give his father
the signal to hoist him up. But, greatly to his astonishment,
his living captive, by the power of its mighty wings, pulling at
the end of the pole, swung him considerably farther into space
than he had calculated. He would have liked to let go both the
gull and the pole, but he perceived instantly that if he did,
he would, by the mere force of his weight, be flung back against
the rocky wall. He did not dare take that risk, as the blow might
be hard enough to stun him. A strange, tingling sensation shot
through his nerves, and the blood throbbed with a surging sound
in his ears. There he hung suspended in mid-air, over a terrible
precipice--and a hundred feet below was the jagged ice-field with
its sharp, fiercely-shining steeples! With a powerful effort of
will, he collected his senses, clinched his teeth, and strove to
think clearly. The gull whirled wildly eastward and westward, and
he swayed with its every motion like a living pendulum between sea
and sky. He began to grow dizzy, but again his powerful will came
to his rescue, and he gazed resolutely up against the brow of the
precipice and down upon the projecting ledges below, in order to
accustom his eye and his mind to the sight. By a strong effort
he succeeded in giving a pull at the rope, and expected to feel
himself raised upward by his father’s strong arms. But, to his
amazement, there came no response to his signal. He repeated it
once, twice, thrice; there was a slight tugging at the rope, but no
upward movement. Then the brave lad’s heart stood still, and his
courage wellnigh failed him.

“Father!” he cried, with a hoarse voice of despair; “why don’t you
pull me up?”

His cry was lost in the roar of the wind, and there came no answer.
Taking hold once more of the rope with one hand, he considered the
possibility of climbing; but the miserable gull, seeming every
moment to redouble its efforts at escape, deprived him of the use
of his hands unless he chose to dash out his brains by collision
with the rock. Something like a husky, choked scream seemed to
float down from above, and staring again upward, he saw his
father’s head projecting over the brink of the precipice.

“The rope will break,” screamed Sigurd. “I have tied it to the
rock.”

Thoralf instantly took in the situation. By the swinging motion,
occasioned both by the wind and his fight with the gull, the
rope had become frayed against the sharp edge of the cliff, and
his chances of life, he coolly concluded, were now not worth a
sixpence. Curiously enough, his agitation suddenly left him, and
a great calm came over him. He seemed to stand face to face with
eternity; and as nothing else that he could do was of any avail,
he could at least steel his heart to meet death like a man and an
Icelander.

“I am trying to get hold of the rope below the place where it is
frayed,” he heard his father shout during a momentary lull in the
storm.

“Don’t try,” answered the boy; “you can’t do it alone. Rather, let
me down on the lower ledge, and let me sit there until you can go
and get someone to help you.”

His father, accustomed to take his son’s advice, reluctantly
lowered him ten or twenty feet until he was on a level with the
shelving ledge below, which was broader than the one upon which he
had first gained foothold. But--oh, the misery of it!--the ledge
did not project far enough! He could not reach it with his feet!
The rope, of which only a few strands remained, might break at
any moment and--he dared not think what would be the result! He
had scarcely had time to consider, when a brilliant device shot
through his brain. With a sudden thrust he flung away the pole, and
the impetus of his weight sent him inward with such force that he
landed securely upon the broad shelf of rock.

The gull, surprised by the sudden weight of the pole, made a
somersault, strove to rise again, and tumbled, with the pole still
depending from its leg, down upon the ice-field.

It was well that Thoralf was warmly clad, or he could never have
endured the terrible hours while he sat through the long afternoon,
hearing the moaning and shrieking of the wind and seeing the
darkness close about him. The storm was chilling him with its
fierce breath. One of the birds he tied about his throat as a sort
of scarf, using the feet and neck for making the knot, and the
dense, downy feathers sent a glow of comfort through him, in spite
of his consciousness that every hour might be his last. If he could
only keep awake through the night, the chances were that he would
survive to greet the morning. He hit upon an ingenious plan for
accomplishing this purpose. He opened the bill of the auk which
warmed his neck, cut off the lower mandible, and placed the upper
one (which was as sharp as a knife) so that it would inevitably
cut his chin in case he should nod. He leaned against the rock and
thought of his mother and the warm, comfortable chimney-corner
at home. The wind probably resented this thought, for it suddenly
sent a biting gust right into his face, and he buried his nose
in the downy breast of the auk until the pain had subsided. The
darkness had now settled upon sea and land; only here and there
white steeples loomed out of the gloom. Thoralf, simply to occupy
his thought, began to count them. But all of a sudden one of the
steeples seemed to move, then another--and another.

The boy feared that the long strain of excitement was depriving
him of his reason. The wind, too, after a few wild arctic howls,
acquired a warmer breath and a gentler sound. It could not be
possible that he was dreaming, for in that case he would soon be
dead. Perhaps he was dead already, and was drifting through this
strange icy vista to a better world. All these imaginings flitted
through his mind, and were again dismissed as improbable. He
scratched his face with the foot of an auk in order to convince
himself that he was really awake. Yes, there could be no doubt of
it; he was wide awake. Accordingly he once more fixed his eyes upon
the ghostly steeples and towers, and--it sent cold shudders down
his back--they were still moving. Then there came a fusillade as
of heavy artillery, followed by a salvo of lighter musketry; then
came a fierce grinding, and cracking, and creaking sound, as if
the whole ocean were of glass and were breaking to pieces. “What,”
thought Thoralf, “is the ice breaking up!” In an instant the
explanation of the whole spectral panorama was clear as the day.
The wind had veered round to the southeast, and the whole enormous
ice-floe was being driven out to sea. For several hours--he could
not tell how many--he sat watching this superb spectacle by the
pale light of the aurora borealis, which toward midnight began to
flicker across the sky and illuminated the northern horizon. He
found the sight so interesting that for a while he forgot to be
sleepy. But toward morning, when the aurora began to fade and the
clouds to cover the east, a terrible weariness was irresistibly
stealing over him. He could see glimpses of the black water beneath
him; and the shining spires of ice were vanishing in the dusk,
drifting rapidly away upon the arctic currents with death and
disaster to ships and crews that might happen to cross their paths.

It was terrible at what a snail’s pace the hours crept along!
It seemed to Thoralf as if a week had passed since his father
left him. He pinched himself in order to keep awake, but it was
of no use; his eyelids would slowly droop and his head would
incline--horrors! what was that? Oh, he had forgotten; it was the
sharp mandible of the auk that cut his chin. He put his hand up
to it, and felt something warm and clammy on his fingers. He was
bleeding. It took Thoralf several minutes to stay the blood--the
wound was deeper than he had bargained for; but it occupied him and
kept him awake, which was of vital importance.

At last, after a long and desperate struggle with drowsiness,
he saw the dawn break faintly in the east. It was a mere feeble
promise of light, a remote suggestion that there was such a thing
as day. But to the boy, worn out by the terrible strain of death
and danger staring him in the face, it was a glorious assurance
that rescue was at hand. The tears came into his eyes--not tears
of weakness, but tears of gratitude that the terrible trial had
been endured. Gradually the light spread like a pale, grayish veil
over the eastern sky, and the ocean caught faint reflections of
the presence of the unseen sun. The wind was mild, and thousands
of birds that had been imprisoned by the ice in the crevices of
the rocks whirled triumphantly into the air and plunged with wild
screams into the tide below. It was hard to imagine where they all
had been, for the air seemed alive with them, the cliffs teemed
with them; and they fought, and shrieked, and chattered, like a
howling mob in times of famine. It was owing to this unearthly
tumult that Thoralf did not hear the voice which called to him
from the top of the cliff. His senses were half-dazed by the noise
and by the sudden relief from the excitement of the night. Then
there came two voices floating down to him--then quite a chorus.
He tried to look up, but the beetling brow of the rock prevented
him from seeing anything but a stout rope, which was dangling in
mid-air and slowly approaching him. With all the power of his
lungs he responded to the call; and there came a wild cheer from
above--a cheer full of triumph and joy. He recognized the voices of
Hunding’s sons, who lived on the other side of the promontory; and
he knew that even without their father they were strong enough to
pull up a man three times his weight. The difficulty now was only
to get hold of the rope, which hung too far out for his hands to
reach it.

“Shake the rope hard,” he called up; and immediately the rope was
shaken into serpentine undulations; and after a few vain efforts,
he succeeded in catching hold of the knot. To secure the rope
about his waist and to give the signal for the ascent was but a
moment’s work. They hauled vigorously, those sons of Hunding--for
he rose, up, along the black walls--up--up--up--with no uncertain
motion. At last, when he was at the very brink of the precipice,
he saw his father’s pale and anxious face leaning out over the
abyss. But there was another face too! Whose could it be? It was
a woman’s face. It was his mother’s. Somebody swung him out into
space; a strange, delicious dizziness came over him; his eyes were
blinded with tears; he did not know where he was. He only knew that
he was inexpressibly happy. There came a tremendous cheer from
somewhere--for Icelanders know how to cheer--but it penetrated but
faintly through his bewildered senses. Something cold touched his
forehead; it seemed to be snow; then warm drops fell, which were
tears. He opened his eyes; he was in his mother’s arms. Little Jens
was crying over him and kissing him. His father and Hunding’s sons
were standing, with folded arms, gazing joyously at him.




MIKKEL.


I.

HOW MIKKEL WAS FOUND.

You may find it hard to believe what I am going to tell you, but
it is, nevertheless, strictly true. I knew the boy who is the hero
of this story. His name was Thor Larsson, and a very clever boy
he was. Still I don’t think he would have amounted to much in the
world, if it had not been for his friend Michael, or, as they write
it in Norwegian, Mikkel. Mikkel, strange to say, was not a boy,
but a fox. Thor caught him, when he was a very small lad, in a den
under the roots of a huge tree. It happened in this way. Thor and
his elder brother, Lars, and still another boy, named Ole Thomlemo,
were up in the woods gathering faggots, which they tied together
in large bundles to carry home on their backs; for their parents
were poor people, and had no money to buy wood with. The boys
rather liked to be sent on errands of this kind, because delicious
raspberries and blueberries grew in great abundance in the woods,
and gathering faggots was, after all, a much manlier occupation
than staying at home minding the baby.

Thor’s brother Lars and Ole Thomlemo were great friends, and
they had a disagreeable way of always plotting and having secrets
together and leaving Thor out of their councils. One of their
favorite tricks, when they wished to get rid of him, was to pretend
to play hide-and-seek; and when he had hidden himself, they would
run away from him and make no effort to find him. It was this trick
of theirs which led to the capture of Mikkel, and to many things
besides.

It was on a glorious day in the early autumn that the three boys
started out together, as frisky and gay as a company of squirrels.
They had no luncheon-baskets with them, although they expected to
be gone for the whole day; but they had hooks and lines in their
pockets, and meant to have a famous dinner of brook-trout up in
some mountain glen, where they could sit like pirates around a
fire, conversing in mysterious language, while the fish was being
fried upon a flat stone. Their _tolle_ knives[6] were hanging,
sheathed, from their girdles, and the two older ones carried,
besides, little hatchets wherewith to cut off the dry twigs and
branches. Lars and Ole Thomlemo, as usual, kept ahead and left Thor
to pick his way over the steep and stony road as best he might; and
when he caught up with them, they started to run, while he sat down
panting on a stone. Thus several hours passed, until they came to
a glen in which the blueberries grew so thickly that you couldn’t
step without crushing a handful. The boys gave a shout of delight
and flung themselves down, heedless of their clothes, and began to
eat with boyish greed. As far as their eyes could reach between the
mossy pine trunks, the ground was blue with berries, except where
bunches of ferns or clusters of wild flowers intercepted the view.
When they had dulled the edge of their hunger, they began to cut
the branches from the trees which the lumbermen had felled, and
Ole Thomlemo, who was clever with his hands, twisted withes, which
they used instead of ropes for tying their bundles together. They
had one bundle well secured and another under way, when Ole, with a
mischievous expression, ran over to Lars and whispered something in
his ear.

“Let us play hide-and-seek,” said Lars aloud, glancing over toward
his little brother, who was working like a Trojan, breaking the
faggots so as to make them all the same length.

Thor, who in spite of many exasperating experiences had not yet
learned to be suspicious, threw down an armful of dry boughs and
answered: “Yes, let us, boys. I am in for anything.”

“I’ll blind first,” cried Ole Thomlemo; “now, be quick and get
yourselves hidden.”

And off the two brothers ran, while Ole turned his face against a
big tree and covered his eyes with his hands. But the very moment
Thor was out of sight, Lars stole back again to his friend, and
together they slipped away under cover of the bushes, until they
reached the lower end of the glen. There, they pulled out their
fish-lines, cut rods with their hatchets, and went down to the
tarn, or brook, which was only a short distance off; the fishing
was excellent, and when the large speckled trout began to leap
out of the water to catch their flies, the two boys soon ceased
to trouble themselves about little Thor, who, they supposed, was
hiding under some bush and waiting to be discovered.

In this supposition they were partly right and partly wrong.

No sooner had Ole Thomlemo given the signal for hiding, than Thor
ran up the hill-side, stumbling over the moss-grown stones, pushing
the underbrush aside with his hands, and looking eagerly for a
place where he would be least likely to be found. He was full of
the spirit of the game, and anticipated with joyous excitement the
wonder of the boys when they should have to give up the search
and call to him to reveal himself. While these thoughts were
filling his brain, he caught sight of a huge old fir-tree, which
was leaning down the mountain-side as if ready to fall. The wind
had evidently given it a pull in the top, strong enough to loosen
its hold on the ground, and yet not strong enough to overthrow
it. On the upper side, for a dozen yards or more, the thick,
twisted roots, with the soil and turf still clinging to them, had
been lifted, so as to form a little den about two feet wide at
the entrance. Here, thought Thor, was a wonderful hiding-place.
Chuckling to himself at the discomfiture of his comrades, he threw
himself down on his knees and thrust his head into the opening.
To his surprise the bottom felt soft to his hands, as if it had
been purposely covered with moss and a layer of feathers and
eider-down. He did not take heed of the peculiar wild smell which
greeted his nostrils, but fearlessly pressed on, until nearly
his whole figure, with the exception of the heels of his boots,
was hidden. Then a sharp little bark startled him, and raising
his head he saw eight luminous eyes staring at him from a dark
recess, a few feet beyond his nose. It is not to be denied that
he was a little frightened; for it instantly occurred to him that
he had unwittingly entered the den of some wild beast, and that,
in case the old ones were at home, there was small chance of his
escaping with a whole skin. It could hardly be a bear’s den, for
the entrance was not half big enough for a gentleman of Bruin’s
size. It might possibly be a wolf’s premises he was trespassing
upon, and the idea made his blood run cold. For Mr. Gray-legs,
as the Norwegians call the wolf, is not to be trifled with; and
a small boy armed only with a knife was hardly a match for such
an antagonist. Thor concluded, without much reflection, that his
safest plan would be to beat a hasty retreat. Digging his hands
into the mossy ground, he tried to push himself backward, but, to
his unutterable dismay, he could not budge an inch. The feathers,
interspersed with the smooth pine-needles, slipped away under his
fingers, and the roots caught in his clothes and held him as in
a vice. He tried to force his way, but the more he wriggled the
more he realized how small was his chance of escape. To turn was
impossible, and to pull off his coat and trousers was a scarcely
less difficult task. It was fortunate that the four inhabitants
of the den, to whom the glaring eyes belonged, seemed no less
frightened than himself; for they remained huddled together in
their corner, and showed no disposition to fight. They only
stared wildly at the intruder, and seemed anxious to know what he
intended to do next. And Thor stared at them in return, although
the darkness was so dense that he could discern nothing except the
eight luminous eyes, which were fixed upon him with an uncanny and
highly uncomfortable expression. Unpleasant as the situation was,
he began to grow accustomed to it, and he collected his scattered
thoughts sufficiently to draw certain conclusions. The size of the
den, as well as the feathers which everywhere met his fumbling
hands, convinced him that his hosts were young foxes, and that
probably their respected parents, for the moment, were on a raid in
search of rabbits or stray poultry. That reflection comforted him,
for he had never known a fox to use any other weapon of defence
than its legs, unless it was caught in a trap and had to fight for
bare life. He was just dismissing from his mind all thought of
danger from that source, when a sudden sharp pain in his heel put
an end to his reasoning. He gave a scream, at which the eight eyes
leaped apart in pairs and distributed themselves in a row along the
curving wall of the den. Another bite in his ankle convinced him
that he was being attacked from behind, and he knew no other way
of defence than to kick with all his might, screaming at the same
time so as to attract the attention of the boys, who, he supposed,
could hardly be far off. But his voice sounded choked and feeble
in the close den, and he feared that no one would be able to hear
it ten yards away. The strong odor, too, began to stifle him, and
a strange dizziness wrapped his senses, as it were, in a gray,
translucent veil. He made three or four spasmodic efforts to rouse
himself, screamed feebly, and kicked; but probably he struck his
wounded ankle against a root or a stone, for the pain shot up his
leg and made him clinch his teeth to keep the tears from starting.
He thought of his poor mother, whom he feared he should never see
again, and how she would watch for his return through the long
night and cry for him, as it said in the Bible that Jacob cried
over Joseph when he supposed that a wild beast had torn him to
pieces and killed him. Curious lights, like shooting stars, began
to move before his eyes; his tongue felt dry and parched, and his
throat seemed burning hot. It occurred to him that certainly God
saw his peril and might yet help him, if he only prayed for help;
but the only prayer which he could remember was the one which the
minister repeated every Sunday for “our most gracious sovereign,
Oscar II., and the army and navy of the United Kingdoms.” Next he
stumbled upon “the clergy, and the congregations committed to their
charge;” and he was about to finish with “sailors in distress at
sea,” when his words, like his thoughts, grew more and more hazy,
and he drifted away into unconsciousness.

Lars and Ole Thomlemo in the meanwhile had enjoyed themselves to
the top of their bent, and when they had caught a dozen trout,
among which was one three-pounder, they reeled up their lines,
threaded the fish on withes, and began to trudge leisurely up the
glen. When they came to the place where they had left their bundles
of faggots, they stopped to shout for Thor, and when they received
no reply, they imagined that, being tired of waiting, he had gone
home alone, or fallen in with some one who was on his way down
to the valley. The only thing that troubled them was that Thor’s
bundle had not been touched since they left him, and they knew that
the boy was not lazy, and that, moreover, he would be afraid to go
home without the faggots. They therefore concluded to search the
copse and the surrounding underbrush, as it was just possible that
he might have fallen asleep in his hiding-place while waiting to be
discovered.

“I think Thor is napping somewhere under the bushes,” cried Ole
Thomlemo, swinging his hatchet over his head like an Indian
tomahawk. “We shall have to halloo pretty loud, for you know he
sleeps like a top.”

And they began scouring the underbrush, traversing it in all
directions, and hallooing lustily, both singly and in chorus.
They were just about giving up the quest, when Lars’s attention
was attracted by two foxes which, undismayed by the noise, were
running about a large fir-tree, barking in a way which betrayed
anxiety, and stopping every minute to dig up the ground with their
fore-paws. When the boys approached the tree, the foxes ran only a
short distance, then stopped, ran back, and again fled, once more
to return.

“Those fellows act very queerly,” remarked Lars, eying the foxes
curiously; “I’ll wager there are young un’s under the tree here,
but”--Lars gasped for breath--“Ole--Ole--Oh, look! What is this?”

Lars had caught sight of a pair of heels, from which a little
stream of blood had been trickling, coloring the stones and
pine-needles. Ole Thomlemo, hearing his comrade’s exclamation of
fright, was on the spot in an instant, and he comprehended at once
how everything had happened.

“Look here, Lars,” he said, resolutely, “this is no time for
crying. If Thor is dead, it is we who have killed him; but if he
isn’t dead, we’ve got to save him.”

“Oh, what shall we do, Ole?” sobbed Lars, while the tears rolled
down over his cheeks, “what shall we do? I shall never dare go home
again if he is dead. We have been so very bad to him!”

“We have got to save him, I tell you,” repeated Ole, tearless and
stern: “we must pull him out; and if we can’t do that, we must cut
through the roots of this fir-tree; then it’ll plunge down the
mountain-side, without hurting him. A few roots that have burrowed
into the rocks are all that keep the tree standing. Now, act like a
man. Take hold of him by one heel and I’ll take the other.”

Lars, who looked up to his friend as a kind of superior being,
dried his tears and grasped his brother’s foot, while Ole carefully
handled the wounded ankle. But their combined efforts had no
perceptible effect, except to show how inextricably the poor lad’s
clothes were intertangled with the tree-roots, which, growing all
in one direction, made entrance easy, but exit impossible.

“That won’t do,” said Ole, after three vain trials. “We might
injure him without knowing it, driving the sharp roots into his
eyes and ears, as likely as not. We’ve got to use the hatchets. You
cut that root and I’ll manage this one.”

Ole Thomlemo was a lumberman’s son, and since he was old enough
to walk had spent his life in the forest. He could calculate
with great nicety how a tree would fall, if cut in a certain
way, and his skill in this instance proved valuable. With six
well-directed cuts he severed one big root, while Lars labored at
a smaller one. Soon with a great crash the mighty tree fell down
the mountain-side, crushing a dozen birches and smaller pines
under its weight. The moss-grown sod around about was torn up with
the remaining roots, and three pretty little foxes, blinded and
stunned by the rush of daylight, sprang out from their hole and
stared in bewilderment at the sudden change of scene. Through the
cloud of flying dust and feathers the boys discerned, too, Thor’s
insensible form, lying outstretched, torn and bleeding, his face
resting upon his hands, as if he were asleep. With great gentleness
they lifted him up, brushed the moss and earth from his face and
clothes, and placed him upon the grass by the side of the brook
which flowed through the bottom of the glen. Although his body was
warm, they could hardly determine whether he was dead or alive,
for he seemed scarcely to be breathing, and it was not until Ole
put a feather before his mouth and perceived its faint inward and
outward movement, that they felt reassured and began to take heart.
They bathed his temples with the cool mountain water and rubbed and
chafed his hands, until at last he opened his eyes wonderingly and
moved his lips, as if endeavoring to speak.

“Where am I?” he whispered at last, after several vain efforts to
make himself heard.

“Why, cheer up, old fellow,” answered Ole, encouragingly; “you have
had a little accident, that’s all, but you’ll be all right in a
minute.”

“Unbutton my vest,” whispered Thor again; “there is something
scratching me here.”

He put his hand over his heart, and the boys quickly tore his
waistcoat open, but to their unutterable astonishment a little
fox, the image of the three that had escaped, put his head out and
looked about him with his alert eyes, as if to say: “Here am I; how
do you like me?” He evidently felt so comfortable where he was,
that he had no desire to get away. No doubt the little creature,
prompted either by his curiosity or a desire to escape from the
den, had crept into Thor’s bosom while he was insensible, and,
finding his quarters quite to his taste, had concluded to remain.
Lars picked him up, tied a string about his neck, and put him in
the side pocket of his jacket. Then, as it was growing late, Ole
lifted Thor upon his back, and he and Lars took turns in carrying
him down to the valley.

Thor’s ankle gave him some trouble, as the wound was slow in
healing. With that exception, he was soon himself again; and he
and Mikkel (for that was the name he gave to the little fox) grew
to be great friends and had many a frolic together.

But the little fox was not a model of deportment, as you will see
when I tell you, in the next chapter, how Mikkel disgraced himself.


II.

HOW MIKKEL DISGRACED HIMSELF.

When Thor was twelve years old, he had to go out into the world
to make his own living; for his parents were poor, and they had
half a dozen younger children, who also had to be fed and clothed.
As it happened, Judge Nannestad, who lived on a large estate down
at the fiord, wanted an office-boy, and as Thor was a bright and
active lad, he had no difficulty in obtaining the situation. The
only question was, how to dispose of Mikkel; for, to be frank,
Mikkel (in spite of his many admirable traits) was not a general
favorite, and Thor suspected that when his protector was away
Mikkel would have a hard time of it. He well knew that Mikkel was
of a peculiar temperament, which required to be studied in order
to be appreciated, and as there was no one but himself who took
this trouble, he did not wonder that his friend was generally
misunderstood. Mikkel’s was not a nature to invite confidences; he
scrupulously kept his own counsel, and was always alert and on his
guard. There was a bland expression on his face, a kind of lurking
smile, which never varied, and which gave absolutely no clew to
his thoughts. When he had skimmed the cream off the milk-pans on
the top shelf in the kitchen, he returned, licking his chops, with
the same inscrutable smile, as if his conscience were as clean
as a new-born babe’s; and when he had slipped his collar over
his head and dispatched the kitten, burying its remains in the
backyard, he betrayed no more remorse than if he had been cracking
a nut. Sultan, the dog, strange to say, had private reasons for
being afraid of him, and always slank away in a shamefaced manner,
whenever Mikkel gave him one of his quiet sidelong glances. And
yet the same Mikkel would roll on his back, and jump and play with
the baby by the hour, seize her pudgy little hands gently with
his teeth, never inflicting a bite or a scratch. He would nestle
on Thor’s bosom inside of his coat, while Thor was learning his
lesson, or he would sit on his shoulder and look down on the book
with his superior smile. It was not to be denied that Mikkel had a
curious character--an odd mixture of good and bad qualities; but
as, in Thor’s judgment, the good were by far the more prominent, he
would not listen to his father’s advice and leave his friend behind
him, when he went down to the judge’s at the grand estate.

It was the day after New-year’s that Thor left the cottage up
under the mountain, and, putting on his skees, slid down the steep
hill-side to the fiord. Mikkel was nestling, according to his wont,
in the bosom of his master’s coat, while his pretty head, with the
clean dark snout and dark mustache, was sticking out above the
boy’s collar, just under his chin. Mikkel had never been so far
away from home before, and he concluded that the world was a bigger
affair than he had been aware of.

It was with a loudly thumping heart that Thor paused outside
the door of the judge’s office, for he greatly feared that the
judge might share the general prejudice against Mikkel, and make
difficulties about his board and lodgings. Instead of entering, he
went to the pump in the yard and washed his friend’s face carefully
and combed his hair with the fragment of a comb with which his
mother had presented him at parting. It was important that Mikkel
should appear to advantage, so as to make a good impression upon
the judge. And really he did look irresistible, Thor thought, with
his bright, black eyes, his dainty paws, and his beautiful red
skin. He felt satisfied that if the judge had not a heart of stone
he could not help being captivated at the sight of so lovely a
creature. Thor took courage and knocked at the door.

“Ah, you are our new office-boy,” said the judge, as he entered;
“but what is that you have under your coat?”

“It is Mikkel, sir, please your Honor,” stammered Thor, putting the
fox on the floor, so as to display his charms. But hardly had he
taken his hands off him, when a sudden scrambling noise was heard
in the adjoining office, and a large hound came bounding with wild
eyes and drooping tongue through the open door. With lightning
speed Mikkel leaped up on the judge’s writing-desk, scattering his
writing materials, upsetting an inkstand by an accidental whisk
of his tail, and bespattering the honorable gentleman’s face and
shirt-front with the black fluid. To perform a similar service on
the next desk, where a clerk was writing, to jump from there to
the shoulder of a marble bust, which fell from its pedestal down
on the hound’s head and broke into a dozen pieces, and to reach a
place of safety on the top of a tall bookcase were all a moment’s
work. The hound lay howling, with a wounded nose, on the floor. The
judge stood scowling at his desk, rubbing the ink all over his face
with his handkerchief, and Mikkel sat smiling on the top of the
bookcase, surveying calmly the ruin which he had wrought. But the
most miserable creature in the room was neither the judge, with his
black face, nor the hound, with the bleeding nose; it was Thor, who
stood trembling at the door, expecting that something still more
terrible would happen. And knowing that, after having caused such a
commotion, his place was forfeited, he held out his arms to Mikkel,
who accepted the invitation, and with all speed at their disposal
they rushed out through the door and away over the snowy fields,
scarcely knowing whither their feet bore them.

After half an hour’s run, when he had no more breath left, Thor
seated himself on a tree-stump and tried to collect his thoughts.
What should he now do? Where should he turn? Go home he could not;
and if he did, it would be the end of Mikkel. The only thing he
could think of was to go around in the parish, from farm to farm,
until he found somebody who would give him something to do.

“I hope you will appreciate, my dear Mikkel,” he said to his fox,
“that it is on your account I have all this trouble. It was very
naughty of you to behave so badly, and if you do it again I shall
have to whip you! Do you understand that, Mikkel?”

Mikkel looked sheepish, which plainly showed that he understood.

“Now, Mikkel,” Thor continued, “we will go to the parson; perhaps
he may have some use for us. What do you think of trying the
parson?”

Mikkel apparently thought well of the parson, for he licked his
master behind his ear and rubbed his snout against his cheek.
Accordingly, by noon they reached the parsonage, and after a
long parley with the pastor’s wife, he was engaged as a sort of
errand-boy, whose duty it should be to do odd jobs about the house.
Mikkel was to have a kennel provided for him in the stable, but
was under no circumstances to enter the house. Thor had to vouch
for his good behavior, and the moment he made himself in any way
obnoxious it was decided that he should be killed. Poor Thor had
nominally to accept these hard conditions, but in his own mind he
determined to run away with Mikkel the moment he was caught in any
kind of mischief. It seemed very hard for Mikkel, too, who had been
accustomed to sleep in Thor’s arms in his warm bed, to be chained,
and to spend the long, dark nights in the stable in a miserable
kennel. Nevertheless, there was no help for it; so Thor went to
work that same afternoon and made Mikkel as comfortable a kennel as
he could, taking care to make the hole which served for entrance no
bigger than it had to be, so that no dog or other enemy should be
able to enter.

For about four months all went well at the parsonage. So long as
Mikkel was confined in the stable he behaved himself with perfect
propriety, and, occasionally, when he was (by special permission)
taken into the house to play with the children, he won golden
opinions for himself by his cunning tricks, and became, in fact,
a great favorite in the nursery. When the spring came and the sun
grew warm, his kennel was, at Thor’s request, moved out into the
yard, where he could have the benefit of the fine spring weather.
There he could be seen daily, lying in the sun, with half-closed
eyes, resting his head on his paws, seeming too drowsy and
comfortable to take notice of anything. The geese and hens, which
were at first a trifle suspicious, gradually grew accustomed to
his presence, and often strayed within range of Mikkel’s chain,
and even within reach of his paws; but it always happened that on
such occasions either the pastor or his wife was near, and Mikkel
knew enough to be aware that goose was forbidden fruit. But one day
(it was just after dinner, when the pastor was taking his nap),
it happened that a great fat gander, prompted by a pardonable
curiosity, stretched his neck a little too far toward the sleeping
Mikkel; when, quick as a wink and wide-awake, Mr. Mikkel jumped
up, and before he knew it, the gander found himself minus his
head. Very cautiously the culprit peered about, and seeing no one
near, he rapidly dug a hole under his kennel and concealed his
victim there, covering it well with earth, until a more favorable
opportunity should present itself for making a meal of it. Then he
lay down, and stretched himself in the sun as before, and seemed
too sleepy even to open his eyes; and when, on the following
day, the gander was missed, the innocent demeanor of Mikkel so
completely imposed upon everyone, that he was not even suspected.
Not even when the second and the third goose disappeared could any
reasonable charge be brought against Mikkel.

When the summer vacation came, however, the even tenor of Mikkel’s
existence was rudely interrupted by the arrival of the parson’s
oldest son, Finn, who was a student in Christiania, and his dog
Achilles. Achilles was a handsome brown pointer, that, having been
brought up in the city, had never been accustomed to look upon the
fox as a domestic animal. He, therefore, spent much of his time in
harassing Mikkel, making sudden rushes for him when he thought him
asleep; but always returning from these exploits shamefaced and
discomfited, for Mikkel was always a great deal too clever to be
taken by surprise. He would lie perfectly still until Achilles was
within a foot of him, and then, with remarkable alertness, he would
slip into the kennel, through his door, where the dog’s size would
not permit him to follow; and the moment his enemy turned his tail
to him, Mikkel’s face would appear bland and smiling, at the door,
as if to say:

“Good-by! Call again whenever you feel like it. Now, don’t you wish
you were as clever as I am?”

And yet in spite of his daily defeats, Achilles could never
convince himself that his assaults upon Mikkel brought him no
glory. Perhaps his master, who did not like Mikkel any too well,
encouraged him in his enmity, for it is certain that the assaults
grew fiercer daily. And at last, one day when the young student
was standing in the yard, holding his dog by the collar, while
exciting him against the half-sleeping fox, Achilles ran with such
force against the kennel that he upset it. Alas! For then the
evidence of Mikkel’s misdemeanors came to light. From the door-hole
of the rolling kennel a heap of goose-feathers flew out, and were
scattered in the air; and, what was worse, a little “dug-out”
became visible, filled with bones and bills and other indigestible
articles, unmistakably belonging to the goose’s anatomy. Mikkel,
who was too wise to leave the kennel so long as it was in motion,
now peeped cautiously out, and he took in the situation at a
glance. Mr. Finn, the student, who thought that Mikkel’s skin would
look charming as a rug before his fire-place in the city, was
overjoyed to find out what a rascal this innocent-looking creature
had been; for he knew well enough that his father would now no
longer oppose his desire for the crafty little creature’s skin. So
he went into the house, loaded his rifle, and prepared himself as
executioner.

But at that very moment, Thor chanced to be coming home from an
errand; and he had hardly entered the yard, when he sniffed danger
in the air. He knew, without asking, that Mikkel’s doom was
sealed. For the parson was a great poultry-fancier and was said
to be more interested in his ganders than he was in his children.
Therefore, without waiting for further developments, Thor unhooked
Mikkel’s chain, lifted the culprit in his arms, and slipped him
into the bosom of his waistcoat. Then he stole up to his garret,
gathered his clothes in a bundle, and watched his chance to escape
from the house unnoticed. And while Master Finn and his dog were
hunting high and low for Mikkel in the barns and stables, Thor
was hurrying away over the fields, every now and then glancing
anxiously behind him, and nearly smothering Mikkel in his efforts
to keep him concealed, lest Achilles should catch his scent.
But Mikkel had his own views on that subject, and was not to be
suppressed; and just as his master was congratulating himself on
their happy escape, they heard the deep baying of a dog, and saw
Achilles, followed by the student with his gun, tracking them in
fierce pursuit. Thor, whose only hope was to reach the fiord,
redoubled his speed, skipped across fences, hedges, and stiles,
and ran so fast that earth and stones seemed to be flying in the
other direction. Yet Achilles’ baying was coming nearer and nearer,
and was hardly twenty feet distant by the time the boy had flung
himself into a boat, and with four vigorous oar-strokes had shot
out into the water. The dog leaped after him, but was soon beyond
his depth, and the high breakers flung him back upon the beach.

“Come back at once,” cried Finn, imperiously. “It is not your
boat. If you don’t obey, I’ll have you arrested.”

Thor did not answer, but rowed with all his might.

“If you take another stroke,” shouted the student furiously,
levelling his gun, “I’ll shoot both you and your thievish fox.”

It was meant only for intimidation; but where Mikkel’s life was at
stake, Thor was not easily frightened.

“Shoot away!” he cried, thinking that he was now at a safe
distance, and that the student’s marksmanship was none of the
best. But before he realized what he had said, whiz! went a bullet
over his head. A stiff gale was blowing, and the little boat was
tossed like a foot-ball on the incoming and the outgoing waves;
but the plucky lad struggled on bravely, until he hove alongside a
fishing schooner, which was to sail the next morning for Drontheim.
Fortunately the skipper needed a deck hand, and Thor was promptly
engaged. The boat which had helped him to escape was found later
and towed back to shore by a fisherman.


III.

HOW MIKKEL MAKES HIS FORTUNE.

In Drontheim, which is a large commercial city on the western
coast of Norway, Thor soon found occupation as office-boy in a
bank, which did business under the name of C. P. Lyng & Co. He
was a boy of an open, fearless countenance, and with a frank and
winning manner. Mr. Lyng, at the time when Thor entered his employ,
had just separated from his partner, Mr. Tulstrup, because the
latter had defrauded the firm and several of its customers. Mr.
Lyng had papers in his safe which proved Mr. Tulstrup’s guilt,
but he had contented himself with dismissing him from the firm,
and had allowed him to take the share of the firm’s property
to which he was legally entitled. The settlement, however, had
not satisfied Mr. Tulstrup, and he had, in order to revenge
himself, gone about to the various customers, whom he had himself
defrauded, and persuaded them to commence suit against Mr. Lyng,
whom he represented as being the guilty party. He did not, at
that time, know that Mr. Lyng had gained possession of the papers
which revealed the real author of the fraud. On the contrary, he
flattered himself that he had destroyed every trace of his own
dishonest transactions.

The fact that Mr. Lyng belonged to a family which had always been
distinguished, in business and social circles, for its integrity
and honor only whetted Tulstrup’s desire to destroy his good name,
and having laid his plans carefully, he anticipated an easy triumph
over honest Mr. Lyng. His dismay, therefore, was very great when,
after the suit had been commenced in the courts, he learned that it
was his own name and liberty which were in danger, and not those
of his former partner. Mr. Tulstrup, in spite of the position he
had occupied, was a desperate man, and was capable, under such
circumstances, of resorting to desperate remedies. But, like
most Norwegians, he had a streak of superstition in his nature,
and cherished an absurd belief in signs and omens, in lucky and
unlucky days, and in spectres and apparitions, foreboding death or
disaster. Mr. Tulstrup’s father had believed in such things, and it
had been currently reported among the peasantry that he had been
followed by a spectral fox, which some asserted to be his wraith,
or double. This fox, it was said, had frequently been seen during
the old man’s lifetime, and when he once saw it himself, he was
frightened nearly out of his wits. Superstitious stories of this
kind are so common in Norway that one can hardly spend a month in
any country district without hearing dozens of them. The belief
in a _fylgia_, or wraith in the shape of an animal, dates far
back into antiquity, and figures largely in the sagas, or ancient
legends of the Northland.

It has already been told that Thor had obtained a position as
office-boy in Mr. Lyng’s bank; and it was more owing to the boy’s
winning appearance than to any fondness for foxes, on Mr. Lyng’s
part, that Mikkel also was engaged. It was arranged that a cushion
whereupon Mikkel might sleep should be put behind the stove in
the back office. At first Mikkel endured his captivity here with
great fortitude; but he did not like it, and it was plain that he
was pining for the parsonage and his kennel in the free air, and
the pleasant companionship of the geese and the stupid Achilles.
Thor then obtained permission to have him walk about unchained,
and the clerks, who admired his graceful form and dainty ways,
soon grew very fond of him, and stroked him caressingly, as he
promenaded along the counter or seated himself on their shoulders,
inspecting their accounts with critical eyes. Thor was very happy
to see his friend petted, though he had an occasional twinge of
jealousy when Mikkel made himself too agreeable to old Mr. Barth,
the cashier, or kissed young Mr. Dreyer, the assistant book-keeper.
Such faithlessness on Mikkel’s part was an ill return for all the
sacrifices Thor had made for him; and yet, hard as it was, it had
to be borne. For an office-boy cannot afford to have emotions, or,
if he has them, cannot afford the luxury of giving way to them.

C. P. Lyng & Co.’s bank was a solid, old-fashioned business-house
which the clerks entered as boys and where they remained all their
lives. Mr. Barth, the cashier, had occupied his present desk
for twenty-one years, and had spent nine years more in inferior
positions. He was now a stout little man of fifty, with close
cropped, highly-respectable side-whiskers and thin gray hair, which
was made to cover his crown by the aid of a small comb. This comb,
which was fixed above his right ear and held the straggling locks
together, was a source of great amusement to the clerks, who made
no end of witticisms about it. But Mr. Barth troubled himself very
little about their poor puns, and sat serenely poring over his
books and packages of bank-bills from morning till night. He prided
himself above all on his regularity, and it was said that he had
never been one minute too late or too early during the thirty years
he had been in Mr. Lyng’s bank; accordingly, he had little patience
with the shortcomings of his subordinates, and fined and punished
them in various ways, if they were but a moment tardy; for the most
atrocious of all crimes, in Mr. Barth’s opinion, was tardiness.
The man who suffered most from his severity was Mr. Dreyer, the
assistant book-keeper. Mr. Dreyer was a good-looking young man,
and very fond of society; and it happened sometimes that, on the
morning after a ball, he would sleep rather late. He had long
rebelled in silence against Mr. Barth’s tyranny, and when he found
that his dissatisfaction was shared by many of the other clerks,
he conceived a plan to revenge himself on his persecutor. To this
end a conspiracy was formed among the younger clerks, and it was
determined to make Mikkel the agent of their vengeance.

It was well known by the clerks that Mr. Barth was superstitious
and afraid in the dark; and it was generally agreed that it
would be capital fun to give him a little fright. Accordingly the
following plan was adopted: A bottle of the oil of phosphorus was
procured and Mikkel’s fur was thoroughly rubbed with it, so that in
the dark the whole animal would be luminous. At five minutes before
five, someone should go down in the cellar and turn off the gas,
just as the cashier was about to enter the back office to lock up
the safe. Then, when the illuminated Mikkel glared out on him from
a dark corner, he would probably shout or faint or cry out, and
then all the clerks should rush sympathetically to him and render
him every assistance.

Thus the plan was laid, and there was a breathless, excited
stillness in the bank when the hour of five approached. It had
been dark for two hours, and the clerks sat on their high stools,
bending silently over their desks, scribbling away for dear life.
Promptly at seven minutes before five, up rose Mr. Barth and gave
the signal to have the books closed; then, to the unutterable
astonishment of the conspirators, he handed the key of the safe to
Mr. Dreyer (who knew the combination), and told him to lock the
safe and return the key. At that very instant, out went the gas;
and Mr. Dreyer, although he was well prepared, could himself hardly
master his fright at Mikkel’s terrible appearance. He struck a
match, lighted a wax taper (which was used for sealing letters),
and tremblingly locked the safe; then, abashed and discomfited, he
advanced to the cashier’s desk and handed him the key.

“Perhaps you would have the kindness, Mr. Dreyer,” said Mr. Barth,
calmly, “to write a letter of complaint to the gas-company before
you go home. It will never do in the world to have such things
happen. I suppose there must be water in the pipes.”

The old man buttoned his overcoat up to his chin and marched out;
whereupon a shout of laughter burst forth, in which Mr. Dreyer did
not join. He could not see what they found to laugh at, he said.
It took him a long while to compose his letter of complaint to the
gas-company.

Mikkel in the meanwhile was feeling very uncomfortable. He could
not help marvelling at his extraordinary appearance. He rubbed
himself against chairs and tables, and found to his astonishment
that he made everything luminous that he touched. He had never
known any respectable fox which possessed this accomplishment,
and he felt sure that in some way something was wrong with him.
He could not sleep, but walked restlessly about on the desks and
counters, bristled with anger at the slightest sound, and was
miserable and excited. He could not tell how far the night had
advanced, when he heard a noise in the back office (which fronted
upon the court-yard) as if a window was being opened. His curiosity
was aroused and he walked sedately across the floor; then he
stopped for a moment to compose himself, for he was well aware that
what he saw was something extraordinary. A man with a dark-lantern
in his hand was kneeling before the safe with a key in his hand.
Mikkel advanced a little farther and paused in a threatening
attitude on the threshold of the door. With his luminous face and
body, and a halo of phosphorescent light round about him, he was
terrible to behold. He gave a little snort, at which the man turned
quickly about. But no sooner had he caught sight of the illuminated
Mikkel than he flung himself on his knees before the little animal,
and with clasped hands and a countenance wild with fear exclaimed:
“Oh, I know who thou art! Pardon me, pardon me! Thou art my
father’s spectral fox! I know thee, I know thee!”

Mikkel had never suspected that he was anything so terrible; but,
as he saw that the man was bent on mischief, he did not think
it worth while to contradict him. He only curved his back and
bristled, until the man, beside himself with fear, made a rush
for the window and leaped out into the court-yard. Then Mikkel,
thinking that he had had excitement enough for one night, curled
himself up on his cushion behind the stove and went to sleep.

The next morning, when Mr. Barth arrived, he found a window in the
back office broken, and the door of the safe wide open. On the
floor lay a bundle of papers, all relating to the transactions of
Tulstrup while a member of the firm, and, moreover, a hat, marked
on the inside with Tulstrup’s name, was found on a chair.

On the same day Mr. Lyng was summoned to the bedside of his former
partner, who made a full confession, and offered to return through
him the money which he had fraudulently acquired. His leg was
broken, and he seemed otherwise shattered in body and mind. It
had been his purpose, he said, to drive Mr. Lyng from the firm
in disgrace, and he was sure he could have accomplished it, if
Providence itself had not interfered. But, incredible as it seemed,
he had seen a luminous animal in the bank, and he felt convinced
that it was his father’s spectral fox. It was well enough to smile
at such things and call them childish, but he had certainly seen,
he said, a wonderful, shining fox.

Mr. Lyng did not attempt to convince Mr. Tulstrup that he was
wrong. He took the money and distributed it among those who
had suffered by Mr. Tulstrup’s frauds, and thus many needy
people--widows and industrious laborers--regained their hard-earned
property, and all because Mikkel’s skin was luminous. When Mr. Lyng
heard the whole story from Mr. Dreyer, he laughed heartily and
long. But from that day he took a warm interest in Thor and his
fox, and sent the former to school and, later, to the university,
where he made an honorable name for himself by his talents and
industry.

Poor Mikkel is now almost gray, and his teeth are so blunt that
he has to have his food minced before he can eat it. But he still
occupies a soft rug behind the stove in the student’s room, and
Thor hopes he will live long enough to be introduced to his
master’s wife. For it would be a pity if she were not to know him
to whom her husband owes his position, and she, accordingly, hers.




THE FAMINE AMONG THE GNOMES.


I believe it was in the winter of 18-- (but it does not matter
so much about the time) that the servants on the large estate of
Halthorp raised a great ado about something or other. Whereupon
the Baron of Halthorp, who was too stout to walk down the stairs
on slight provocation, called his steward, in a voice like that of
an angry lion, and asked him, “Why in the name of Moses he did not
keep the rascals quiet.”

“But, your lordship,” stammered the steward, who was as thin as
the baron was stout, “I have kept them quiet for more than a month
past, though it has been hard enough. Now they refuse to obey me
unless I admit them to your lordship’s presence, that they may
state their complaint.”

“Impudent beggars!” growled the old gentleman. “Tell them that I
am about to take my after-dinner nap, and that I do not wish to be
disturbed.”

“I have told them that a dozen times,” whined the steward,
piteously. “But they are determined to leave in a body, unless your
lordship consents to hear them.”

“Leave! They can’t leave,” cried his honor. “The law binds them.
Well, well, to save talking, fling the doors open and let them come
in.”

The steward hobbled away to the great oak-panelled doors (I forgot
to tell you that he limped in his left foot), and, cautiously
turning the knob and the key, peeped out into the hall. There stood
the servants--twenty-eight in all--but, oh! what a sight! They
were hollow-cheeked, with hungry eyes and bloodless lips, and deep
lines about their mouths, as if they had not seen food for weeks.
Their bony hands twitched nervously at the coarse clothes that
flapped in loose folds about their lean and awkward limbs. They
were indeed a pitiful spectacle. Only a single one of them--and
that was of course the cook--looked like an ordinary mortal, or
an extraordinary mortal, if you like, for he was nearly as broad
as he was long. It was owing to the fact that he walked at the
head of the procession, as they filed into the parlor, that the
baron did not immediately discover the miserable condition of the
rest. But when they had faced about, and stood in a long row from
wall to wall--well, you would hardly believe it, but the baron,
hard-hearted as he was, came near fainting. There is a limit to
all things, and even a heart of steel would have been moved at the
sight of such melancholy objects.

“Steward,” he roared, when he had sufficiently recovered himself,
“who is the demon who has dared to trifle with my fair name and
honor? Name him, sir--name him, and I will strangle him on the
spot!”

The steward, even if he had been acquainted with the demon, would
have thought twice before naming him under such circumstances.
Accordingly he was silent.

“Have I not,” continued the baron, still in a voice that made his
subjects quake--“have I not caused ample provisions to be daily
distributed among you? Have not you, Mr. Steward, the keys to my
store-houses, and have you not my authority to see that each member
of my household is properly provided for?”

The steward dared not answer; he only nodded his head in silence.

“If it please your lordship,” finally began a squeaky little voice
at the end of the row (it was that of the under-groom), “it isn’t
the steward as is to blame, but it’s the victuals. Somehow there
isn’t any taste nor fillin’ to them. Whether I eat pork and cabbage
or porridge with molasses, it don’t make no difference. It all
tastes alike. As I say, your lordship, the old Nick has got into
the victuals.”

The under-groom had hardly ceased speaking before the baron, who
was a very irascible old gentleman, seized his large gold-headed
cane and as quickly as his bulk would allow, rushed forward to give
vent to his anger.

“I’ll teach you manners, you impudent clown!” he bawled out, as,
with his cane lifted above his head, he rushed into the ranks of
the frightened servants, shouting to the under-groom, “Criticise my
victuals, will you, you miserable knave!”

The under-groom having on former occasions made the acquaintance of
the baron’s cane, and still remembering the unpleasant sensation,
immediately made for the door, and slipped nimbly out before a
blow had reached him. All the others, who had to suffer for their
spokesman’s boldness, tumbled pell-mell through the same opening,
jumped, rolled, or vaulted down the steps, and landed in a confused
heap at the bottom of the stairs.

The baron, in the meanwhile, marched with long strides up and down
the floor, and expressed himself, not in the politest language,
concerning the impudence of his domestics.

“However,” he grumbled to himself, “I must look into this affair
and find out what fraud there is at the bottom of it. The poor
creatures couldn’t get as lean as that unless there was some real
trouble.”

About three hours later the baron heard the large bell over the
gable of his store-house ring out for dinner. The wood-cutters and
the men who drove the snow-plough, and all other laborers on the
large estate, as soon as they heard it, flung away their axes and
snow-shovels and hurried up to the mansion, their beards and hair
and eyebrows all white with hoar-frost, so that they looked like
walking snow-men. But as it happened, the under-groom, Nils Tagfat,
chanced at that moment to be cutting down a large snow-laden
fir-tree which grew on a projecting knoll of the mountain. He
pulled off his mittens and blew on his hands (for it was bitter
cold), and was about to shoulder his axe, when suddenly he heard a
chorus of queer little metallic voices, as it seemed, right under
his feet. He stopped and listened.

“There is the bell of Halthorp ringing! Where is my cap? where is
my cap?” he heard distinctly uttered, though he could not exactly
place the sound, nor did he see anybody within a mile around.
And just for the joke of the thing, Nils, who was always a jolly
fellow, made his voice as fine as he could, and, mimicking the
tiny voices, squeaked out:

“Where is my cap? Where is my cap?”

But imagine his astonishment when suddenly he heard a voice answer
him: “You can take grandfather’s cap!” and at the same moment
there was tossed into his hands something soft, resembling a small
red-peaked cap. Just out of curiosity, Nils put it on his head
to try how it would fit him, and small as it looked, it fitted
him perfectly. But now, as the cap touched his head, his eyes
were opened to the strangest spectacle he ever beheld. Out of the
mountain came a crowd of gnomes, all with little red-peaked caps,
which made them invisible to all who were not provided with similar
caps. They hurried down the hill-side toward Halthorp, and Nils,
who was anxious to see what they were about, followed at a proper
distance behind. As he had half expected, they scrambled up on the
railings at the door of the servants’ dining-hall, and as soon as
the door was opened they rushed in, climbed up on the chairs, and
seated themselves on the backs just as the servants took their
places on the seats. And now Nils, who, you must remember, had on
the cap that made him invisible, came near splitting his sides with
laughter. The first course was boiled beef and cabbage. The smell
was delicious to Nils’s hungry nostrils, but he had to conquer his
appetite in order to see the end of the game. The steward stood at
the end of the table and served each with a liberal portion; and
at the steward’s side sat the baron himself, in a large, cushioned
easy-chair. He did not eat, however; he was there merely to see
fair play.

Each servant fell to work greedily with his knife and fork, and
just as he had got a delicious morsel half-way to his mouth, the
gnome on the back of his chair stretched himself forward and
deftly snatched the meat from the end of the fork. Thus, all the
way around the table, each man unconsciously put his piece of beef
into the wide-open mouth of his particular gnome. And the unbidden
guests grinned shrewdly at one another, and seemed to think it
all capital fun. Sometimes, when the wooden trays (which were
used instead of plates) were sent to be replenished, they made
horrrible grimaces, often mimicking their poor victims, who chewed
and swallowed and went through all the motions of eating, without
obtaining the slightest nourishment. They all would have liked to
fling knives and forks and trays out through the windows, but they
had the morning’s chastisement freshly in mind, and they did not
dare open their mouths, except for the futile purpose of eating.

“Well, my lads and lasses,” said the baron, when he had watched the
meal for some minutes; “if you can complain of food like this, you
indeed deserve to be flogged and put on prison fare.”

“Very likely, your lordship,” said one of the milkmaids; “but if
your lordship would demean yourself to take a morsel with us, we
would bless your lordship for your kindness and complain no more.”

[Illustration: THE BARON SPRANG UP WITH AN EXCLAMATION OF FRIGHT.]

The baron, looking around at all the hopeless eyes and haggard
faces, felt that there was something besides vanity that
prompted the request; and he accordingly ordered the cook to bring
his own plate and drew his chair up to the table. Hardly had he
seized his knife when Nils saw a gnome, who had hitherto been
seated on the floor awaiting his turn, crawl up on the arm of his
big chair and, standing on tiptoe, seize between his teeth the
first bit the baron was putting to his mouth. The old gentleman
looked astounded, mystified, bewildered; but, fearing to make
an exhibition of himself, selected another mouthful, and again
conducted it the accustomed way. The gnome came near laughing right
out, as he despatched this second morsel in the same manner as the
first, and all around the table the little monsters held their
hands over their mouths and seemed on the point of exploding. The
baron put down knife and fork with a bang; his eyes seemed to be
starting out of his head, and his whole face assumed an expression
of unspeakable horror.

“It is Satan himself who is mocking us!” he cried. “Send for the
priest! Send for the priest!”

Just then Nils crept around behind the baron, who soon felt
something soft, like a fine skull-cap, pressed on his head, and
before he had time to resent the liberty, he started in terror at
the sight of the little creature that he saw sitting on the arm of
his chair. He sprang up with an exclamation of fright, and pushed
the chair back so violently that it was almost upset upon the
floor. The gnome dexterously leaped down and stood staring back at
the baron for an instant; then, with a spring, he snatched a potato
and half a loaf of bread, and disappeared. In his haste, the
baron ran against Nils, the under-groom, who (now without a cap)
was standing with a smiling countenance calmly surveying all the
confusion about him.

“Now, was I right, your lordship?” he asked, with a respectful bow.
“Did _you_ find the victuals very filling?”

The baron, who was yet too frightened to answer, stood gazing
toward a window-pane, which suddenly and noiselessly broke, and
through which the whole procession of gnomes, huddled together in
flight, tumbled headlong into the snow-bank without.

“And what shall we do, Nils,” said the baron, the next day, when
he had recovered from his shock, “to prevent the return of the
unbidden guests?”

“Stop ringing the great bell,” answered Nils. “It is that which
invites the gnomes.”

And since that day the dinner-bell has never been rung at Halthorp.

But one day, late in the winter, Nils the groom, as he was
splitting wood on the mountain-side, heard a plaintively tinkling
voice within, singing:

      “Hunger and sorrow each new day is bringing,
      Since Halthorp bell has ceased its ringing.”




HOW BERNT WENT WHALING.


Bernt Holter and his sister Hilda were sitting on the beach,
playing with large spiral cockles which they imagined were cows
and horses. They built stables out of chips, and fenced in their
pastures, and led their cattle in long rows through the deep
grooves they had made in the sand.

“When I grow up to be a man,” said Bernt, who was twelve years
old, “I am going to sea and catch whales, as father did when he
was young. I don’t want to stand behind a counter and sell calico
and tape and coffee and sugar,” he continued, thrusting his chest
forward, putting his hands into his pockets, and marching with a
manly swagger across the beach. “I don’t want to play with cockles,
like a baby, any more,” he added, giving a forcible kick to one of
Hilda’s finest shells and sending it flying across the sand.

“I wish you wouldn’t be so naughty, Bernt,” cried his sister, with
tears in her eyes. “If you don’t want to play with me, I can play
alone. Bernt, oh--look there!”

Just at that moment a dozen or more columns of water flew high into
the air, and the same number of large, black tail-fins emerged from
the surface of the fiord, and again slowly vanished.

“Hurrah!” cried Bernt, in great glee, “it is a school of dolphins.
Good-by, Hilda dear, I think I’ll run down to the boat-house.”

“I think I’ll go with you, Bernt,” said his sister, obligingly,
rising and shaking the sand from her skirts.

“I think you’ll not,” remarked her brother, angrily; “I can run
faster than you.”

So saying, he rushed away over the crisp sand as fast as his
feet would carry him, while his sister Hilda, who was rather a
soft-hearted girl, and ready with her tears, ran after him, all
out of breath and calling to him at the top of her voice. Finally,
when she was more than half way to the boat-house, she stumbled
against a stone and fell full length upon the beach. Bernt, fearing
that she might be hurt, paused in his flight and returned to pick
her up, but could not refrain from giving her a vindictive little
shake, as soon as he discovered that she had sustained no injury.

“I do think girls are the greatest bother that ever was invented,”
he said, in high dudgeon. “I don’t see what they are good for,
anyway.”

“I want to go with you, Bernt,” cried Hilda.

Seeing there was no escape, he thought he might just as well be
kind to her.

“You may go,” he said, “if you will promise never to tell anybody
what I am going to do?”

“No, Bernt, I shall never tell,” said the child, eagerly, and
drying her tears.

“I am going a-whaling,” whispered Bernt, mysteriously. “Come
along!”

“Whaling!” echoed the girl, in delicious excitement. “Dear Bernt,
how good you are! Oh, how lovely! No, I shall never tell it to
anybody as long as I live.”

It was late in the afternoon, and the sun, which at that time of
the year never sets in the northern part of Norway, threw its red,
misty rays like a veil of dull flame over the lofty mountains
which, with their snow-hooded peaks, pierced the fiery clouds;
their huge reflections shone in soft tints of red, green, and blue
in the depth of the fiord, whose glittering surface was calm and
smooth as a mirror. Only in the bay which the school of dolphins
had entered was the water ruffled; but there, high spouts rose
every moment into the air and descended again in showers of fine
spray.

“It is well that father has gone away with the fishermen,” said
Bernt, as he exerted himself with all his might to push his small
boat down over the slippery beams of the boat-house. “Here, Hilda,
hold my harpoon for me.”

Hilda, greatly impressed with her own dignity in being allowed
to hold so dangerous a weapon as a harpoon, grasped it eagerly
and held it up in both her arms. Bernt once more put his shoulder
to the prow of his light skiff (which, in honor of his father’s
whaling voyages, he had named The North Pole) and with a tremendous
effort set it afloat. Then he carefully assisted Hilda into the
boat, in the stern of which she seated herself. Next he seized the
oars and rowed gently out beyond the rocky headland toward which
he had seen the dolphins steer their course. He was an excellent
sailor for his years, and could manage a boat noiselessly and well.

“Hilda, take the helm,” he whispered, “or, if you were only good
for anything, you might paddle and we should be upon them in a
minute. Now, remember, and push the tiller to the side opposite
where I want to go.”

“I’ll remember,” she replied, breathlessly.

The gentle splashing of the oars and the clicking of the rowlocks
were the only sounds which broke the silence of the evening. Now
and then a solitary gull gave a long, shrill scream as she dived
beneath the surface of the fiord, and once a fish-hawk’s loud,
discordant yell was flung by the echoes from mountain to mountain.

“Starboard,” commanded Bernt, sternly; but Hilda in her agitation
pushed the tiller to the wrong side and sent the boat flying to
port.

“Starboard, I said!” cried the boy, indignantly; “if I had known
you would be so stupid, I should never have taken you along.”

“Please, brother dear, do be patient with me,” pleaded the girl,
remorsefully. “I shall not do it again.”

It then pleased his majesty, Bernt Holter, to relent, although his
sister had by her awkwardness alarmed the dolphins, sending the
boat right in their wake, when it had been his purpose to head them
off. He knew well enough that it takes several minutes for a whole
school of so large a fish as the dolphin to change its course, and
the hunter would thus have a good chance of “pricking” a laggard
before he could catch up with his companions. Bernt strained every
muscle, while coolly keeping his eye on the water to note the
course of his game. His only chance was in cutting across the bay
and lying in wait for them at the next headland. For he knew very
well that if they were seriously frightened and suspected that
they were being pursued, they could easily beat him by the speed
and dexterity of their movements. But he saw to his delight that
his calculations were correct. Instead of taking the straight
course seaward, the dolphins, being probably in pursuit of fresh
herring, young cod, and other marine delicacies which they needed
for their late dinner, steered close to land where the young fish
are found in greater abundance, and their following the coastline
of the bay gave Bernt a chance of cutting them off and making their
acquaintance at closer quarters. Having crossed the little bay, he
commanded his sister to lie down flat in the bottom of the boat--a
command which she willingly, though with a quaking heart, obeyed.
He backed cautiously into a little nook among the rocks from which
he had a clear passage out, and having one hand on his harpoon,
which was secured by a rope to the prow of the boat, and the other
on the boat-hook (with which he meant to push himself rapidly out
into the midst of the school), he peered joyously over the gunwale
and heard the loud snorts, followed by the hissing descent of the
spray, approaching nearer and nearer. Now, steady my boy! Don’t
lose your presence of mind! One, two, three--there goes! Jumping
up, fixing the boat-hook against the rock, and with a tremendous
push shooting out into the midst of the school was but a moment’s
work. Whew! The water spouts and whirls about his ears as in a
shower-bath. Off goes his cap. Let it go! But stop! What was that?
A terrific slap against the side of the boat as from the tail of
a huge fish. Hilda jumps up with a piercing shriek and the boat
careens heavily to the port side, the gunwale dipping for a moment
under the water. A loud snort, followed again by a shower of spray,
is heard right ahead, and, at the same moment, the harpoon flies
through the air with a fierce whiz and lodges firmly in a broad,
black back. The huge fish in its first spasm of pain gives a fling
with its tail and for an instant the little boat is lifted out of
the water on the back of the wounded dolphin.

“Keep steady, don’t let go the rope!” shouts Bernt at the top of
his voice, “he won’t hurt--”

But before he had finished, the light skiff, with a tremendous
splash, struck the water again, and the little coil of rope to
which the harpoon was attached flew humming over the gunwale and
disappeared with astonishing speed into the deep.

Bernt seized the cord, and when there was little left to spare,
tied it firmly to the prow of the boat, which then, of course,
leaped forward with every effort of the dolphin to rid itself of
the harpoon. The rest of the school, having taken alarm, had sought
deep water, and were seen, after a few minutes, far out beyond the
headland.

“I want to go home, Bernt,” Hilda exclaimed, vehemently. “I want to
go home; I don’t want to get killed, Bernt.”

“You silly thing! You can’t go home now. You must just do as I
tell you; but, of course--if you only are sensible--you won’t get
killed, or hurt at all.”

While he was yet speaking, the boat began all of a sudden to move
rapidly over the water.

The dolphin had bethought him of flight, not knowing that, however
swiftly he swam, he pulled his enemy after him. As he rose to the
surface, about fifty or sixty yards ahead, a small column of water
shot feebly upward, and spread in a fan-like, irregular shape
before it fell. The poor beast floundered along for a few seconds,
its long, black body in full view, and then again dived down,
dragging the boat onward with a series of quick convulsive pulls.

Bernt held on tightly to the cord, while the water foamed and
bubbled about the prow and surged in swirling eddies in the wake of
the skiff.

“If I can only manage to get that dolphin,” said Bernt, “I know
father will give me at least a dollar for him. There’s lots of
blubber on him, and that is used for oil to burn in lamps.”

The little girl did not answer, but grasped the gunwale hard
on each side, and gazed anxiously at the foaming and bubbling
water. Bernt, too, sat silent in the prow, but with a fisherman’s
excitement in his face. The sun hung, huge and fiery, over the
western mountains, and sent up a great, dusky glare among the
clouds, which burned in intense but lurid hues of red and gold.
Gradually, and before they were fully aware of it, the boat began
to rise and descend again, and Bernt discovered by the heavy, even
roll of the water that they must be near the ocean.

“Now you may stop, my dear dolphin,” he said, coolly. “We don’t
want you to take us across to America. Who would have thought that
you were such a tough customer anyway?”

He let go the rope, and, seating himself again, put the oars into
the rowlocks. He tried to arrest the speed of the boat by vigorous
backing; but, to his surprise, found that his efforts were of no
avail.

“Hilda,” he cried, not betraying, however, the anxiety he was
beginning to feel, “take the other pair of oars and let us see what
you are good for.”

Hilda, not realizing the danger, obeyed, a little tremblingly,
perhaps, and put the other pair of oars into their places.

“Now let us turn the boat around,” sternly commanded the
boy. “It’s getting late, and we must be home before bedtime.
One--two--three--pull!”

The oars struck the water simultaneously and the boat veered half
way around; but the instant the oars were lifted again, it started
back into its former course.

“Why don’t you cut the rope and let the dolphin go?” asked Hilda,
striving hard to master the tears, which again were pressing to her
eyelids.

“Not I,” answered her brother; “why, all the fellows would laugh
at me if they heard how I first caught the dolphin and then the
dolphin caught me. No, indeed. He hasn’t much strength left by this
time, and we shall soon see him float up.”

He had hardly uttered these words, when they shot past a rocky
promontory, and the vast ocean spread out before them. Both sister
and brother gave an involuntary cry of terror. There they were,
in their frail little skiff, far away from home, and with no boat
visible for miles around. “Cut the rope, cut the rope! Dear Bernt,
cut the rope!” screamed Hilda, wringing her hands in despair.

“I am afraid it is too late,” answered her brother, doggedly. “The
tide is going out, and that is what has carried us so swiftly to
sea. I was a fool that I didn’t think of it.”

“But what shall we do--what shall we do!” moaned the girl, hiding
her face in her apron.

“Stop that crying,” demanded her brother, imperiously. “I’ll tell
you what we shall have to do. We couldn’t manage to pull back
against the tide, especially here at the mouth of the fiord, where
the current is so strong. We had better keep on seaward, and then,
if we are in luck, we shall meet the fishing-boats when they
return, which will be before morning. Anyway, there is little or
no wind, and the night is light enough, so that they cannot miss
seeing us.”

“Oh, I shall surely die, I shall surely die!” sobbed Hilda,
flinging herself down in the bottom of the boat.

Bernt deigned her no answer, but sat gazing sullenly out over the
ocean toward the western horizon, over which the low sun shed its
lurid mist of fire. The ocean broke with a mighty roar against the
rocks, hushed itself for a few seconds, and then hurled itself
against the rocks anew. To be frank, he was not quite so fearless
as he looked; but he thought it cowardly to give expression to
his fear, and especially in the presence of his sister, in whose
estimation he had always been a hero. The sun sank lower until it
almost touched the water. The rope hung perfectly slack from the
prow, and only now and then grew tense as if something was feebly
tugging at the other end. He concluded that the dolphin had bled
to death or was exhausted. In the meanwhile, they were drifting
rapidly westward, and the hollow noise of the breakers was growing
more and more distant. From a merely idle impulse of curiosity
Bernt began to haul in his rope, and presently saw a black body,
some ten or twelve feet long, floating up only a few rods from the
boat. He gave four or five pulls at the rope and was soon alongside
of it. Bernt felt very sad as he looked at it, and was sorry he had
killed the harmless animal. The thought came into his mind that his
present desperate situation was God’s punishment on him for his
cruel delight in killing.

“But God would not punish my sister for my wickedness,” he
reflected, gazing tenderly at Hilda, who lay in the boat with her
hands folded under her cheek, having sobbed herself to sleep. He
felt consoled, and, murmuring a prayer he had once heard in church
for “sailors in distress at sea,” lay down at his sister’s side and
stared up into the vast, red dome of the sky above him. The water
plashed gently against the sides of the skiff as it rose and rocked
upon the great smooth “ground swell,” and again sank down, as it
seemed into infinite depths, only to climb again the next billow.
Bernt felt sleepy and hungry, and the more he stared into the sky
the more indistinct became his vision. He sprang up, determined to
make one last, desperate effort, and strove to row in toward land,
but he could make no headway against the strong tide, and with
aching limbs and a heavy heart he again stretched himself out in
the bottom of the boat. Before he knew it he was fast asleep.

He did not know how long he had slept, but the dim, fiery look of
the sun had changed into an airy rose color, when he felt someone
seizing him by the arm and crying out: “In the name of wonders,
boy, how did you come here?”

He rubbed his eyes and saw his father’s shaggy face close to his.

“And my dear little girl too,” cried the father, in a voice of
terror. “Heaven be praised for having preserved her!”

And he lifted Hilda in his arms and pressed her close to his
breast. Bernt thought he saw tears glistening in his eyes. That
made him suddenly very solemn. For he had never seen his father cry
before. Around about him was a fleet of some thirty or forty boats
laden to the gunwale with herring. He now understood his rescue.

“Now tell me, Bernt, truthfully,” said his father, gravely, still
holding the sobbing Hilda tightly in his embrace, “how did this
happen?”

“I went a-whaling,” stammered Bernt, feeling not at all so brave as
he had felt when he started on his voyage. But he still had courage
enough to point feebly to the dead dolphin which lay secured a
short distance from the skiff.

“Wait till we get home,” said his father, “then _I’ll_ go
a-whaling.”

He stood, for a while, gazing in amazement at the huge fish, then
again at his son, as if comparing their bulk. He felt that he
ought to scold the youthful sportsman, but he knew it was in the
blood, and was therefore more inclined to praise his daring spirit.
Accordingly, when he got home, he did not go a-whaling.

“Bernt,” he said, patting the boy’s curly head, “you may be a brave
lad; but next time your bravery gets the better of you--leave the
little lass at home.”




THE COOPER AND THE WOLVES.


Tollef Kolstad was a cooper, and a very skilful cooper he was said
to be. He had a little son named Thor, who was as fond of his
father as his father was of him. Whatever Tollef did or said, Thor
was sure to imitate; if Tollef was angry and flung a piece of wood
at the dog who used to come into the shop and bother him, Thor,
thinking it was a manly thing to do, flung another piece at poor
Hector, who ran out whimpering through the door.

Thor, of course, was not very old before he had a corner in his
father’s shop, where, with a small set of tools which had been
especially bought for him, he used to make little pails and buckets
and barrels, which he sold for five or ten cents apiece to the boys
of the neighborhood. All the money earned in this way he put into
a bank of tin, made like a drum, of which his mother kept the key.
When he grew up, he thought, he would be a rich man.

The last weeks before Christmas are, in Norway, always the
briskest season in all trades; then the farmer wants his horses
shod, so that he may take his wife and children to church in his
fine, swan-shaped sleigh; he wants bread and cakes made to last
through the holidays, so that his servants may be able to amuse
themselves, and his guests may be well entertained when they call;
and, above all, he wants large tubs and barrels, stoutly made of
beech staves, for his beer and mead, with which he pledges every
stranger who, during the festival, happens to pass his door. You
may imagine, then, that at Christmas time coopers are much in
demand, and that it is not to be wondered at if sometimes they are
behind-hand with their orders. This was unfortunately the case with
Tollef Kolstad at the time when the strange thing happened which
I am about to tell you. He had been at work since the early dawn,
upon a huge tub or barrel, which had been ordered by Grim Berglund,
the richest peasant in the parish. Grim was to give a large party
on the following day (which was Christmas-Eve), and he had made
Tollef promise to bring the barrel that same night, so that he
might pour the beer into it, and have all in readiness for the
holidays, when it would be wrong to do any work. It was about ten
o’clock at night when Tollef made the last stroke with his hatchet
on the large hollow thing, upon which every blow resounded as on a
drum. He went to a neighbor and hired from him his horse and flat
sleigh, and was about to start on his errand, when he heard a tiny
voice calling behind him:

“Father, do take me along, too!”

“I can’t, my boy. There may be wolves on the lake, to-night, and
they might like to eat up little boys who stay out of bed so late.”

“But I am not afraid of them, father. I have my whip and my
hatchet, and I’ll whip them and cut them.”

Thor here made some threatening flourishes with his weapons in the
air, indicating how he would give it to the wolves in case they
should venture to molest him.

“Well, come along, you little rascal,” said his father, laughing,
and feeling rather proud of his boy’s dauntless spirit. “You and I
are not to be trifled with when we get mad, are we, Thor?”

“No, indeed, father,” said Thor, and clenched his little mittened
fist.

Tollef then lifted him up, wrapped him warmly in his sheepskin
jacket, and put him between his knees, while he himself seized the
reins and urged the horse on.

It was a glorious winter night. The snow sparkled and shone as if
sprinkled with starry diamonds, the aurora borealis flashed in
pale, shifting colors along the horizon, and the moon sailed calmly
through a vast, dark-blue sea of air. Little Thor shouted with
delight as he saw the broad expanse of glittering ice, which they
were about to cross, stretching out before them like a polished
shield of steel.

“Oh, father, I wish we had taken our skates along, and pulled your
barrel across on a sled,” cried the boy, ecstatically.

“That I might have done, if I had had a sled large enough for the
barrel,” replied the father. “But then we should have been obliged
to pull it up the hills on the other side.”

The sleigh now struck the ice and shot forward, swinging from
side to side, as the horse pulled a little unevenly. Whew! how
the cold air cut in their faces. How it whizzed and howled in
the tree-tops! Hark! What was that? Tollef instinctively pressed
his boy more closely to him. Hush!--his heart stood still, while
that of the boy, who merely felt the reflex shock of his father’s
agitation, hammered away the more rapidly. A terrible, long-drawn
howl, as from a chorus of wild, far-away voices, came floating away
over the crowns of the pine-trees.

“What was that, father,” asked Thor, a little tremulously.

“It was wolves, my child,” said Tollef, calmly.

“Are you afraid, father?” asked the boy again.

“No, child, I am not afraid of one wolf, nor of ten wolves; but if
they are in a flock of twenty or thirty, they are dangerous. And if
they scent our track, as probably they will, they will be on us in
five minutes.”

“How will they scent our track, father?”

“They smell us in the wind; and the wind is from us and to them,
and then they howl to notify their comrades, so that they may
attack us in sufficient force.”

“Why don’t we return home, then?” inquired the boy, still with a
tolerably steady voice, but with sinking courage.

“They are behind us. Our only chance is to reach the shore before
they overtake us.”

The horse, sniffing the presence of wild beasts, snorted wildly
as it ran, but, electrified as it were, with the sense of danger,
strained every nerve in its efforts to reach the farther shore. The
howls now came nearer and nearer, and they rose with a frightful
distinctness in the clear, wintry air, and resounded again from
the border of the forest.

“Why don’t you throw away the barrel, father?” said Thor, who, for
his father’s sake, strove hard to keep brave. “Then the sleigh will
run so much the faster.”

“If we are overtaken, our safety is in the barrel. Fortunately, it
is large enough for two, and it has no ears and will fit close to
the ice.”

Tollef was still calm; but, with his one disengaged arm, hugged his
little son convulsively.

“Now, keep brave, my boy,” he whispered in his ear. “They will soon
be upon us. Give me your whip.”

It just occurred to Tollef that he had heard that wolves were very
suspicious, and that men had often escaped them by dragging some
small object on the ground behind them. He, therefore, broke a
chip from one of the hoops of the barrel, and tied it to the lash
of the whip; just then he heard a short, hungry bark behind him,
and, turning his head, saw a pack of wolves, numbering more than a
dozen, the foremost of which was within a few yards of the sleigh.
He saw the red, frothy tongue hanging out of its mouth, and he
smelt that penetrating, wild smell with which everyone is familiar
who has met a wild beast in its native haunts. While encouraging
the reeking, foam-flecked horse, Tollef, who had only half faith
in the experiment with the whip, watched anxiously the leader of
the wolves, and observed to his astonishment that it seemed to be
getting no nearer. One moment it seemed to be gaining upon them,
but invariably, as soon as it reached the little chip which was
dragging along the ice, this suddenly arrested its attention and
immediately its speed slackened. The cooper’s hope began to revive,
and he thought that perhaps there was yet a possibility that they
might see the morrow’s sun. But his courage again began to ebb when
he discovered in the distance a second pack of wolves, larger than
the first, and which, with terrific speed, came running, leaping,
and whirling toward them from another direction. And while this
terrible discovery was breaking through his almost callous sense,
he forgot, for an instant, the whip, the lash of which swung under
the runners of the sleigh and snapped. The horse, too, was showing
signs of exhaustion, and Tollef, seeing that only one chance was
left, rose up with his boy in his arms, and upsetting the barrel
on the ice, concealed himself and the child under it. Hardly had
he had time to brace himself against its sides, pressing his feet
against one side and his back against the other, when he heard the
horse giving a wild scream, while the short, whining bark of the
wolves told him that the poor beast was selling its life dearly.
Then there was a desperate scratching and scraping of horseshoes,
and all of a sudden the sound of galloping hoof-beats on the ice,
growing fainter and fainter. The horse had evidently succeeded in
breaking away from the sleigh, and was testing his speed in a race
for life. Some of the wolves were apparently pursuing him, while
the greater number remained to investigate the contents of the
barrel. The howling and barking of these furious creatures without
was now incessant. Within the barrel it was dark as pitch.

“Now, keep steady!” said Tollef, feeling a sudden shock, as if
a wolf had leaped against their improvised house with a view to
upsetting it. He felt himself and the boy gliding a foot or two
over the smooth ice, but there was no further result from the
attack. A minute passed: again there came a shock, and a stronger
one than the first. A long, terrible howl followed this second
failure. The little boy, clutching his small cooper’s hatchet in
one hand, sat pale but determined in the dark, while with the other
he clung to his father’s arm.

“Oh, father!” he cried, in terror, “I feel something on my back.”

The father quickly struck a light, for he fortunately had a supply
of matches in his pocket, and saw a wolf’s paw wedged in between
the ice and the rim of the barrel; and in the same instant he tore
the hatchet from his son’s hand and buried its edge in the ice.
Then he handed the amputated paw to Thor, and said:

“Put that into your wallet, and the sheriff will pay you a reward
for it.[7] For a wolf without paws couldn’t do much harm.”

While he was yet speaking, a third assault upon the barrel lifted
one side of it from the ice, and almost overturned it. Instead of
pushing against the part nearest the ice, a wolf, more cunning than
the rest, had leaped against the upturned bottom.

You can imagine what a terrible night father and son spent
together in this constant struggle with the voracious beasts, that
never grew weary of attacking their hiding-place. The father was
less warmly clad than the son, and, moreover, was obliged to sit
on the ice, while Thor could stand erect without knocking against
the bottom of the barrel; and if it had not been for the excitement
of the situation, which made Tollef’s blood course with unwonted
rapidity, it is more than probable that the intense cold would have
made him drowsy, and thus lessened his power of resistance. The
warmth of his body had made a slight cavity where he was sitting,
and whenever he remained a moment still, his trousers froze fast to
the ice. It was only the presence of his boy that inspired him with
fresh courage, whenever hope seemed about to desert him.

About an hour after the flight of the horse, when five or six
wolves’ paws had been cut off in the same manner as the first,
there was a lull in the attack, but a sudden increase of the
howling, whining, yelping, and barking noise without. Tollef
concluded that the wolves, maddened by the smell of blood, were
attacking their wounded fellows; and as their howls seemed to come
from a short distance, he cautiously lifted one side of the barrel
and peered forth; but in the same instant a snarling bark rang
right in his ear, and two paws were thrust into the opening. Then
came a howl of pain, and another paw was put into Thor’s wallet.

But hark! What is that? It sounds like a song, or rather like a
hymn. The strain comes nearer and nearer, resounding from mountain
to mountain, floating peacefully through the pure and still air:

      “Who knows how near I am mine ending;
      So quickly time doth pass away.”

Tollef, in whose breast hope again was reviving, put his ear to the
ice, and heard distinctly the tread of horses and of many human
feet. He listened for a minute or more, but could not discover
whether the sound was coming any nearer. It occurred to him that
in all probability the people, being unarmed, would have no desire
to cope with a large pack of wolves, especially as to them there
could be no object in it. If they saw the barrel, how could they
know that there was anybody under it? He comprehended instantly
that his only chance of life was in joining those people before
they were too far away. And, quickly resolved, he lifted the boy
on his left arm, and grasped the hatchet in his disengaged hand.
Then, with a violent thrust, he flung the barrel from over him, and
ran in the direction of the sound. The wolves, as he had inferred,
were lacerating their bleeding comrades; but the moment they saw
him, a pack of about a dozen immediately started in pursuit. They
leaped up against him on all sides, while he struck furiously about
him with his small weapon. Fortunately, he had sharp steel pegs on
his boots, and kept his footing well; otherwise the combat would
have been a short one. His voice, too, was powerful, and his shouts
rose high above the howling of the beasts. He soon perceived that
he had been observed, and he saw in the bright moonlight six or
eight men running toward him. Just then, as perhaps in his joy his
vigilance was for a fraction of a second relaxed, he felt a pull in
the fleshy part of his right arm. He was not conscious of any sharp
pain, and was astonished to see the blood flowing from an ugly
wound. But he only held his boy the more tightly, while he fought
and ran with the strength of despair.

Now the men were near. He could hear their voices. But his brain
was dizzy, and he saw but dimly.

“Hello, friend; don’t crack my skull for my pains!” someone was
shouting close to his ear, and he let his hatchet fall, and he fell
himself, too, prostrate on the ice.

The wolves, at the sight of the men, had retired to a safe
distance, from which they watched the proceedings, as if uncertain
whether to return.

As soon as Tollef had recovered somewhat from his exhaustion and
his loss of blood, he and his boy were placed upon a sleigh, and
his wound was carefully bandaged. He now learned that his rescuers
were on their way to a funeral, which was to take place on the next
day, but, on account of the distance to the church, they had been
obliged to start during the night. Hence their solemn mood, and
their singing of funeral hymns.

After an hour’s ride they reached the cooper’s cottage, and were
invited to rest and to share such hospitality as the house could
afford. But when they were gone, Tollef clasped his sleeping boy
in his arms and said to his wife: “If it had not been for him, you
might have had no husband to-day. It was his little whip and toy
hatchet that saved our lives.”

Eleven wolves’ paws were found in Thor’s wallet, and, on Christmas
eve, he went to the sheriff with them and received a reward which
nearly burst his old savings-bank, and compelled his mother to buy
a new one.




MAGNIE’S DANGEROUS RIDE


I.

Magnie was consumed with the hunting fever. He had been away to
school since he was ten years old, and had never had the chance
of doing anything remarkable. While his brother, Olaf, who was a
midshipman in the navy, roamed about the world, and had delightful
adventures with Turks and Arabs, and all sorts of outlandish
people, Magnie had to scan Virgil and Horace and torment his soul
with algebraic problems. It was not at all the kind of life he
had sketched out for himself, and if it had not been his father
who had imposed it upon him, he would have broken away from all
restraints and gone to Turkey or China, or some place where
exciting things happened. In the meanwhile, as he lacked money
for such an enterprise, he would content himself with whatever
excitement there was in hunting, and as his brothers, Olaf and
little Edwin (who was fourteen years old), were also at home for
the vacation, there was a prospect of many delightful expeditions
by sea and by land. Moreover, their old friend Grim Hering-Luck,
who was their father’s right-hand man, had promised to be at their
disposal and put them on the track of exciting experiences. They
had got each a gun, and had practised shooting at a target daily
since their return from the city. Magnie, or Magnus Birk, as his
real name was, had once (though Olaf stoutly maintained that it was
mere chance) hit the bull’s-eye at a hundred yards, and he was now
eager to show his skill on something more valuable than a painted
target. It was, therefore, decided that Grim and the boys should go
reindeer-hunting. They were to be accompanied by the professional
hunter, Bjarne Sheepskin.

It was a glorious morning. The rays of the sun shot from the
glacier peaks in long radiant shafts down into the valley. The
calm mirror of the fiord glittered in the light and fairly dazzled
the eye, and the sea-birds drifted in noisy companies about the
jutting crags, plunged headlong into the sea, and scattered the
spray high into the air. The blue smoke rose perpendicularly from
the chimneys of the fishermen’s cottages along the beach, and the
housewives, still drowsy with sleep, came out, rubbed their eyes
and looked toward the sun to judge of the hour. One boat after
another was pushed out upon the water, and the ripples in their
wakes spread in long diverging lines toward either shore. The fish
leaped in the sun, heedless of the gulls which sailed in wide
circles under the sky, keeping a sharp lookout for the movements
of the finny tribe. The three boys could only stand and gaze in
dumb astonishment upon the splendid sights which the combined
heavens, earth, and sea afforded. Their father, who was much
pleased with their determination and enterprise, had readily given
his consent to the reindeer hunt, on condition that Grim should
take command and be responsible for their safety. They were now
mounted upon three sturdy ponies, while their provisions, guns,
and other commodities were packed upon a fourth beast--a shaggy
little monster named Bruno, who looked more like a hornless goat
than a horse. Bjarne Sheepskin, a long, round-shouldered fellow,
with a pair of small, lively eyes, was leading this heavily laden
Bruno by the bridle, and the little caravan, being once set in
motion, climbed the steep slopes toward the mountains with much
persistence and dexterity. The ponies, which had been especially
trained for mountain climbing, planted their hoofs upon the
slippery rocks with a precision which was wonderful to behold,
jumped from stone to stone, slipped, scrambled up and down, but
never fell. As they entered the pine forest, where the huge trunks
grew in long, dark colonnades, letting in here and there stray
patches of sunshine, partridges and ptarmigan often started under
the very noses of the horses, and Magnie clamored loudly for his
gun, and grew quite angry with Bjarne, who would allow “no fooling
with tomtits and chipmunks, when they were in search of big game.”
Even hares were permitted to go unmolested; and it was not until a
fine capercailzie[8] cock tumbled out of the underbrush close to
the path, that Bjarne flung his gun to his cheek and fired. The
capercailzie made a somersault in the air, and the feathers flew
about it as it fell. Bjarne picked it up quietly, tied its legs
together, and hung it on the pommel of Edwin’s saddle. “That will
make a dinner for gentlefolks,” he said, “if the dairy-maids up on
the _saeters_ should happen to have nothing in the larder.”

Gradually, as they mounted higher, the trees became more stunted in
their growth, and the whole character of the vegetation changed.
The low dwarf-birch stretched its long, twisted branches along
the earth, the silvery-white reindeer-moss clothed in patches the
barren ground, and a few shivering alpine plants lifted their
pale, pink flowers out of the general desolation. As they reached
the ridge of the lower mountain range the boys saw before them a
scene the magnificence of which nearly took their breath away.
Before them lay a wide mountain plain, in the bottom of which two
connected lakes lay coldly glittering. Round about, the plain was
settled with rude little log-houses, the so-called _saeters_,
or mountain dairies, where the Norse peasants spend their brief
summers, pasturing their cattle.

They started at a lively trot down the slope toward this highland
plain, intending to reach the Hasselrud _saeter_, where they
expected to spend the night; for it was already several hours past
noon, and there could be no thought of hunting reindeer so late in
the day. Judging by appearances, the boys concluded that fifteen or
twenty minutes would bring them to the _saeter_; but they rode on
for nearly two hours, and always the cottages seemed to recede, and
the distance showed no signs of diminishing. They did not know how
deceptive all distances are in this wondrously clear mountain air,
whose bright transparency is undimmed by the dust and exhalations
of the lower regions of the earth. They would scarcely have
believed that those huge glacier peaks, which seemed to be looming
up above their very heads, were some eight to twelve miles away,
and that the eagle which soared above them was far beyond the range
of their rifles.

It was about five o’clock when they rode in upon the _saeter_
green, where the dairy-maids were alternately blowing their horns
and yodelling. Their long flaxen braids hung down their backs,
and their tight-fitting scarlet bodices and white sleeves gave
them a picturesque appearance. The cattle were lowing against the
sky, answering the call of the horn. The bells of cows, goats, and
sheep were jangled in harmonious confusion; and the noise of the
bellowing bulls, the bleating sheep, and the neighing horses was
heard from all sides over the wide plain.

The three brothers were received with great cordiality by the
maids, and they spent the evening, after the supper was finished,
in listening to marvellous stories about the ogres who inhabited
the mountains, and the hunting adventures with which Bjarne
Sheepskin’s life had been crowded, and which he related with a
sportsman’s usual exaggerations. The beds in one of the _saeter_
cottages were given up to the boys, and they slept peacefully until
about four o’clock in the morning, when Grim aroused them and told
them that everything was ready for their departure. They swallowed
their breakfast hastily, and started in excited silence across the
plateau. Edwin and the horses they left behind in charge of the
dairy-maids, but took with them an old staghound who had some good
blood in him, and a finer scent than his sedate behavior and the
shape of his nose would have led one to suppose.

Light clouds hovered under the sky; the mist lay like a white
sheet over the mountain, and drifted in patches across the plain.
Bjarne and Grim were carrying the guns, while Olaf led the hound,
and Magnus trotted briskly along, stopping every now and then to
examine every unfamiliar object that came in his way. The wind blew
toward them, so that there was no chance that their scent could
betray them, in case there were herds of deer toward the north at
the base of the glaciers. They had not walked very far, when Bjarne
put his hand to his lips and stooped down to examine the ground.
The dog lifted his nose and began to snuff the air, wag his tail,
and whine impatiently.

“Hush, Yutul,” whispered Bjarne; “down! down, and keep still!”

The dog crouched down obediently and held his peace.

“Here is a fresh track,” the hunter went on, pointing to a hardly
perceptible depression in the moss. “There has been a large herd
here--one buck and at least a dozen cows. Look, here is a stalk
that has just been bitten off, and the juice is not dry yet.”

“How long do you think it will be before we shall meet them?” asked
Magnus, breathlessly. The hunting-fever was throbbing in his
veins, and he crawled cautiously among the bowlders with his rifle
cocked.

“Couldn’t tell; may be an hour, may be three. Hand me your
field-glass, Lieutenant, and I will see if I can catch sight of
’em. A gray beast ain’t easily seen agin the gray stone. It was fer
the same reason I wanted ye to wear gray clothes; we don’t want to
give the game any advantage, fer the sentinels be allers on the
lookout fer the herd, and at the least bit of unfamiliar color,
they give their warnin’ snort, and off starts the flock, scudding
away like a drift of mist before the wind.”

Crouching down among the lichen-clad rocks, all listened in eager
expectation.

“Down!” whispered Bjarne, “and cock rifles! A pair of antlers
agin the snow! Hallo! it is as I thought--a big herd. One, two,
three--five--seven--ten--fourteen! One stunnin’ buck, worth his
forty dollars at least. Now follow me slowly. Look out for your
guns! You, Grim, keep the dog muzzled.”

The boys strained their eyes above the edge of the stones, but
could see nothing. Their hearts hammered against their sides, and
the blood throbbed in their temples. As far as their eyes could
reach they saw only the gray waste of bowlders, interrupted here
and there by patches of snow or a white glacier-stream, which
plunged wildly over a precipice, while a hovering moke indicated
its further progress through the plain. Nevertheless, trusting
the experience of their leader, they made no remark, but crept
after him, choosing like him every available stone for cover.
After half an hour of this laborious exercise, Bjarne suddenly
stretched himself flat upon the ground, and the others, though
seeing no occasion for such a manœuvre, promptly followed his
example. But the next moment enlightened them. Looming up against
the white snow, some sixty or a hundred feet from them, they saw
a magnificent pair of antlers, and presently the whole body of a
proud animal was distinctly visible against the glacier. In the
ravine below a dozen or more cows with their calves were nibbling
the moss between the stones, but with great deliberateness, lifting
their heads every minute and snuffing the air suspiciously; they
presently climbed up on the hard snow and began a frolic, the like
of which the boys had never seen before. The great buck raised
himself on his hind-legs, shook his head, and made a leap, kicking
the snow about him with great vehemence. Several of the cows took
this as an invitation for a general jollification, and they began
to frisk about, kicking their heels against the sky and shaking
their heads, not with the wanton grace of their chief, but with
half-pathetic attempts at imitation. This, Magnus thought, was
evidently a reindeer ball; and very sensible they were to have
it early in the morning, when they felt gay and frisky, rather
than in the night, when they ought to be asleep. What troubled
him, however, was that Bjarne did not shoot; he himself did not
venture to send a bullet into the big buck, although it seemed
to him he had an excellent aim. The slightest turn in the wind
would inevitably betray them, and then they would have had all
their toil for nothing. He would have liked to suggest this to
Bjarne; but in order to do this, he would have to overtake him, and
Bjarne was still wriggling himself cautiously forward among the
stones, pushing himself on with his elbows, as a seal does with
his flippers. In his eagerness to impart his counsel to Bjarne,
Magnus began to move more rapidly; raising himself on his knees
he quite inadvertently showed his curly head above a bowlder. The
buck lifted his superb head with a snort, and with incredible speed
the whole herd galloped away; but in the same moment two bullets
whistled after them, and the buck fell flat upon the snow. The
cow which had stood nearest to him reared on her hind-legs, made
a great leap, and plunged headlong down among the stones. With
a wild war-whoop, the boys jumped up, and Magnus, who had come
near ruining the whole sport, seized, in order to make up for
his mishap, a long hunting-knife and rushed forward to give the
buck the _coup-de-grace_,[9] in accordance with the rules of the
chase. Bounding forward with reckless disregard of all obstacles,
he was the first down on the snow. In one instant he was astride
of the animal, and had just raised his knife, when up leaped the
buck and tore away along the edge of the snow like a gust of wind.
The long-range shot, hitting him in the head, had only stunned
him, but had not penetrated the skull. And, what was worse, in
his bewilderment at the unexpected manœuvre, Magnus dropped his
knife, seizing instinctively the horns of the reindeer to keep
from falling. Away they went with a terrific dizzying speed. The
frightened boy clung convulsively to the great antlers; if he
should fall off, his head would be crushed against the bowlders.
The cold glacier-wind whistled in his ears, and stung his face
like a multitude of tiny needles. He had to turn his head in order
to catch his breath; and he strained his eyes to see if anything
was being done by his companions for his rescue. But he could see
nothing except a great expanse of gray and white lines, which ran
into each other and climbed and undulated toward him and sloped
away, but seemed associated with no tangible object. He thought,
for a moment, that he saw Grim Hering-Luck aiming his gun, but
he seemed to be up in the sky, and to be growing huger and huger
until he looked more like a fantastic cloud than a man. The thought
suddenly struck him that he might be fainting, and it sent a thrill
of horror through him. With a vehement effort he mastered his fear
and resolved that, whatever happened, he would not give way to
weakness. If he was to lose his life, he would, at all events, make
a hard fight for it; it was, on the whole, quite a valuable life,
he concluded, and he did not mean to sell it cheaply.

Troubling himself little about the direction his steed was taking,
he shut his eyes, and began to meditate upon his chances of escape;
and after some minutes, he was forced to admit that they seemed
very slim. When the buck should have exhausted his strength, as
in the course of time he must, he would leave his rider somewhere
in this vast trackless wilderness, where the biting wind swept
down from the eternal peaks of ice, where wolves roamed about
in great hungry companies, and where, beside them, the reindeer
and the ptarmigan were the only living things amid the universal
desolation. When he opened his eyes again, Magnus discovered that
the buck had overtaken the fleeing herd, which, however, were
tearing away madly at his approach, being evidently frightened
at the sight and the scent of the unfamiliar rider. The animal
was still galloping on, though with a less dizzying rapidity, and
Magnus could distinguish the general outline of the objects which
seemed to be rushing against him, as if running a race in the
opposite direction. The herd were evidently betaking themselves
into the upper glacier region, where no foot less light and swift
than theirs could find safety among the terrible ravines and
crevasses.

Fully an hour had passed, possibly two, and it seemed vain to
attempt to measure the distance which he had passed over in this
time. At all events, the region did not present one familiar
object, and of Olaf and his companions Magnie saw no trace. The
only question was, what chance had they of finding him, if they
undertook to search for him, as, of course, they would. If he
could only leave some sign or mark by which they might know the
direction he had taken, their search might perhaps be rewarded with
success. He put one hand in his pocket, but could find nothing
that he could spare except a red silk handkerchief. That had the
advantage of being bright, and would be sure to attract attention.
The dog would be likely to detect it or to catch the scent of it.
But he must have something heavy to tie up in the handkerchief,
or it might blow “all over creation.” The only thing he could find
was a silver matchbox which he had obtained by a trade with Olaf,
and which bore the latter’s initials. He carefully emptied it,
and put the matches (which he foresaw might prove useful) in his
vest-pocket; then tied up the box securely and dropped it, with
the handkerchief, upon a conspicuous rock, where its bright color
might appear striking and unnatural. He was just on the ridge of
what proved to be a second and higher mountain plateau, the wild
grandeur of which far transcended that of the first. Before him lay
a large sheet of water of a cool green tint, and so clear that the
bottom was visible as far as the eye could reach. A river had made
its way from the end of this lake and plunged, in a series of short
cataracts, down the slope to the lower plain.

It made Magnus shiver with dread to look at this coldly glittering
surface, and what was his horror when suddenly his reindeer, in his
pursuit of the herd, which were already in the water, rushed in,
and began, with loud snorts, to swim across to the farther shore!
This was an unforeseen stratagem which extinguished his last hope
of rescue; for how could Bjarne track him through the water, and
what means would he find of crossing, in case he should guess that
the herd had played this dangerous trick on him? He began to dread
also that the endurance of the buck would be exhausted before he
reached dry land again, and that they might both perish miserably
in the lake. In this horrible distress nothing occurred to him
except to whisper the Lord’s Prayer; but as his terror increased,
his voice grew louder and louder, until he fairly shouted the
words, “And deliver us from evil,” and the echoes from the vast
solitudes repeated, first clearly and loudly, then with fainter and
fainter accents: “And deliver us from evil--and deliver us from
evil.” His despairing voice rang strangely under the great empty
sky, and rumbled among the glaciers, which flung it back and forth
until it died away in the blue distance. It was as if the vast
silent wilderness, startled at the sound of a human voice, were
wonderingly repeating the strange and solemn words.

A vague sense of security stole over him when he had finished his
prayer. But the chill of the icy water had nearly benumbed his
limbs, and he feared that the loss of heat would conquer his will,
and make him unconscious before the buck should reach the shore. He
felt distinctly his strength ebbing away, and he knew of nothing
that he could do to save himself. Then suddenly a daring thought
flashed through his brain. With slow and cautious movements he drew
his legs out of the water, and, standing for a moment erect on the
buck’s back, he crawled along his neck and climbed up on the great
antlers, steadying himself carefully and clinging with all his
might. His only fear was that the animal would shake him off and
send him headlong into the icy bath from which he was endeavoring
to escape. But, after two futile efforts, during which the boy had
held on only by desperate exertion, the buck would probably have
resigned himself to his fate, if he had not been in imminent danger
of drowning. Magnus was, therefore, much against his will, forced
to dip his limbs into the chilly water, and resume his former
position. It was a strange spectacle, to see all the horned heads
round about sticking out of the water, and Magnus, though he had
always had a thirst for adventures, had never expected to find
himself in such an incredible situation. Fortunately, they were now
approaching the shore, and whatever comfort there was in having
_terra firma_ under his feet would not be wanting to him. The last
minutes were indeed terribly long, and again and again the buck,
overcome with fatigue, dipped his nose under the water, only to
raise it again with a snort, and shake his head as if impatient to
rid himself of his burden. But the boy, with a spark of reviving
hope, clung only the more tenaciously to the antlers, and remained
unmoved.

At last--and it seemed a small eternity since he had left his
brother and companions--Magnus saw the herd scramble up on the
stony beach. The buck he rode was soon among the foremost, and,
having reached the land, shook his great body and snorted violently.

“Now’s my chance,” thought Magnus; “now I can slide off into the
snow before he takes to his heels again.”

But, odd as it may seem, he had a reluctance to part company with
the only living creature (except the wolves) that inhabited this
awful desert. There was a vague chance of keeping from freezing
to death as long as he clung to the large, warm animal; while,
seated alone upon this bleak shore, with his clothes wringing
wet, and the cold breath of the glacier sweeping down upon him, he
would die slowly and miserably with hunger and cold. He was just
contemplating this prospect, seeing himself in spirit lying dead
upon the shore of the lake, and picturing to himself the grief of
his brother and father, when suddenly his glance was arrested by
what seemed a faint column of smoke rising from among the bowlders.
The herd of reindeer had evidently made the same discovery, for
they paused, in a startled manner, and wheeled about toward the
easterly shore, past which a branch of the glacier was pushing
downward into the lower fiord-valley.

Magnie, who had by this time made up his mind not to give up his
present place except for a better one, strained his eye in the
opposite direction, to make sure that he was not deceived; and
having satisfied himself that what he saw was really smoke, he
determined to leap from his seat at the very first opportunity. But
as yet the speed of the buck made such a venture unsafe. With every
step, however, the territory was becoming more irregular, and made
the progress even of a reindeer difficult.

Magnus drew up his feet, and was about to slide off, having planned
to drop with as slight a shock as possible upon a flat moss-grown
rock, when, to his utter amazement, he saw a human figure standing
at the edge of the glacier, and aiming a rifle, as it appeared,
straight at his head. He tried to scream, but terror choked his
voice. He could not bring forth a sound. And before even the
thought had taken shape in his bewildered brain he saw a flash,
and heard the report of a shot which rumbled away with tremendous
reverberations among the glaciers. There was a surging sound in his
ears, and strange lights danced before his eyes. He thought he must
be dead.
